## Purpose

This document describes the `playscribe` automated process to summarize a YouTube link with ChatGPT.

## Audience

The audience for this document includes:

* User who will send a command with YouTube URL via a Telegram Bot, and receive a text with summarization of its transcript.

* DevSecOps Engineer who will design system workflows, configure and manage any SaaS or selfhosted services, and plan for disaster recovery.

## Why `playscribe`?

1. This summarization-as-a-service leverages on and applies a similar design from the [SudokuCliBot](https://dennislwm.netlify.app/posts/look-mum-no-servers/) automation to its workflow.

2. This service uses resources in both a free tier and a pay-per-usage tier by cloud SaaS providers:

  |   Free    | Pay-per-usage |
  |:---------:|:-------------:|
  | Pipedream |    ChatGPT    |
  |  GitHub   |               |
  | Telegram  |               |

3. This service is inexpensive, easy to implement, and can be duplicated for other services.

4. This service does not require implementing a custom frontend as the User will interact with a Telegram Bot.

5. This service does not require a backend server as the processing will be performed using ephemeral resources.

## Limitation

This project has several limitations:

* The Telegram Bot has a content limit for messages sent to the User.
* The pipeline job may exceed the time of the fixed delayed step in the workflow.
* The message is truncated after `40` lines and will include a link to the file `examples/result.txt`. However, the content of this file may be overridden by another pipeline.
* The workflow system does not allow conditional branches.
