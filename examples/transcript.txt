hi everyone this is Kei from investment modes uh I know I 
haven't been doing-some of these videos for a while but uh 
I still see that there's still the OD-odd few here and 
there who subscribe to to my video so I'm quite thankful 
for-that so uh as I look at the second half of 2024 I think 
I have more time to do-some of these videos and some of 
these videos I think I'll try to be uh-dedicated to 
actually re uh release on on YouTube without releasing on 
my blog-uh investment mod.com and I think where better 
to-start than to uh continue where we left off and to talk 
more about income-planning for singaporeans and today's 
question is-more of uh a question regarding this uh income 
spending system that I've talked-about in the past called 
the safe withdrawal rate or the S SWR for short-so um there 
are some questions regarding like uh based on the 
assumptions that is-put in place for for this uh uh 
spending income frame framework and whether it-will work if 
let's say you would like a different kind of asset 
allocations for-your portfolio and if you wish for a 
different kind of uh income need such as-uh if you if you 
need it for longer some some of us who aspire to be 
financially-independent we might have not not we might have 
uh a longer Tel-of income needs so uh does this work work 
for that so we'll try to explore-this topic topic today the 
long the the short answer is yes it it can be-adaptable but 
let's see let let's see how we can uh this this this 
framework-is flexible enough to actually accommodate that 
so uh so but before-before that we got to take take a step 
back to to think about like why why are-you interested in 
this uh safe withdrawal rate framework or any of-these 
framework uh in the first place and one of the key reasons 
is that uh-you have this uh this income needs that that 
you're looking for so this is a-good good good model how 
how how it looks like visually you have this uh-Capital you 
that you have have bu build up over the O over time and you 
would-like to um spend from this portfolio to have this 
income stream stream itself-and you want this income stream 
to last for for for long enough long long enough-until the 
end of your income needs and for a lot of us it is uh 
before is is uh-sometimes after we pass pass away so 
there's a there's a period of spending-there's a there's a 
there's a unique income need itself and therefore uh 
this-is what what make this problem this this income 
problems quite quite unique and I-think uh almost all of us 
are interested in in uh in in in trying to figure this-this 
out and and one of the one one of the uh framework income 
framework that I-trust more is actually the safe withdrawal 
rate framework so uh in the-past uh I did a video uh 
explaining the 4% sa safe withdrawal rate which is one-of 
the most uh pre prevalently prevalently uh uh uh safe 
withdrawal-rate that is put put out there I created that 
video because I realized that-there's a lot of 
misconception about what what is it about so uh I'll link 
in-the in in the description below and uh today I won't 
explain so so so much but-but generally this safe 
withdrawal rate it boil down to a certain percentage-figure 
and this percentage figure is a is a very nice rule of time 
for to help-you figure out uh these three questions 
together and this question is how much-you can spend uh 
during this income meets period and how long would 
your-money last during this income meets period And I think 
preferably is that if-you are looking for it to last for 50 
years and then this is how how how how-long it lasts and 
during this period what is the strategy uh the 
the-portfolio strategy to use what kind of uh asset 
allocate asset allocation uh do-you need to be in and um 
what what uh this framework actually boils down to is-this 
uh certain very s simple percentage figure and and as as 
stated um what what-is actually derived is actually this 
four 4% safe withdrawal rate which we're-going to explore 
later whether it is really like four four 4% okay so a 
very-good example will be something like this taken from 
from my last presentation on-the safe withraw rate you can 
imagine that Kei requires uh he has four $4-million and 
he's he wonders like how much he can spend how long his 
income uh-income will last and what is his ass asset 
allocation so with this let's say-a 4% safe withdrawal rate 
you can figure out like what is the the starting 
income-needs so income available for spending will be like 
4 million 4% which is 160-thou th000 a year okay and based 
on the research uh this this this income will-last uh for 
about 20 25 25 years and the asset allocation uh used uh in 
in in-this framework mainly is 50% Diversified equity and 
div 50% uh Diversified fixed-income P portfolio itself now 
to be clear inside if if you look at the the-actual paper 
they actually went Mr bangan actually went through a 
few-different alloc allocations but in the end like I think 
this this was actually-the most cited allocation itself and 
and it's it's very nice that if you have-this 4 4% you you 
know the income and and this income is actually 
inflation-adjusted based on the prevailing like like like 
uh in inflation rate and and-you will know like roughly 
what's the T tner that that they will last and so-this will 
help a lot in in in in your planning but with this one it 
also come-uh brings up certain questions like oh um what if 
actually I need it longer-what if let's say my asset 
allocation is different so would this still work work-or 
not so so uh before you before we look at this this table 
right the answer-to to that is that uh I think there's 
limitation in what uh Mr benan actually-uh went through in 
uh 19 uh the 1990s but shortly after that he he also 
put-out uh further further articles further research to 
actually build build on that-and not just him a lot of 
people also build on this this itself so it kind of-becomes 
a framework and when we say a framework it means that um he 
sort of-give us a certain idea how we go about doing this 
rigorous test and what is the-outcome of this so with that 
in mind in in mind run right uh it helps us in that-uh we 
can actually go through this framework and then determine 
that for-different like different T tenners and and 
different kind of income needs on-right what's what's the 
uh safe withdrawal rate that we can use so over-here you 
can see a table that I think I also show it in in in in my 
last-presentation but I think we can spend more time on it 
okay the First Column-shows the initial safe withdrawal 
rate and this will be the rates that is like-kind of 
similar to this one uh so if you look at this one let's say 
this is 3% so-instead of uh using 4% over here we're using 
3% of this 4 million to determine-what is the income and 
you can see there's different different rates over-here and 
for these different rates rates right it's applicable for 
different kind-of uh uh uh in income needs whether it's uh 
if it's less than 10 years 10 years-10 years to 20 years 40 
years to 60 years or if even if you wish for this to-be 
Perpetual okay and I give some examples on the last colum 
like like say-say say for example if you have a 1 million 
portfolio what kind of income-come are you looking to start 
so one clear thing that you can see from this-one is that 
like over here the the the the tenner of the income needs 
uh as it-goes down it becomes higher and higher until 
perpetual and what you'll notice-is that the safe 
withdrawal rate will be dropping from 7% to below two-2.5% 
which basically tell tells you that hey if you require the 
income to last-long okay then you the safe withdrawal that 
that that uh that you actually-start with to actually 
figure out how much is your income and the capital that-you 
require is lower okay now why why will people need about 60 
years or to to-Perpetual you can imagine someone who sold 
off their business at about 30-years old run right uh 
logically speaking he might have about 60 years of-of of 
lifespan left and even for himself he might want to plan 
for generational-wealth which means that this money to last 
not just uh for him but also for-his uh children and his 
children's children okay so so if this is the-questions 
that he would like to answer on right how much Capital 
should he uh-have if let's say let's say if his income need 
is about 200,000 a year or-300,000 a year you can work 
backwards you you take this 300,000 divided by two-2.5% and 
you work out with with with a certain figures o over here 
so this is-uh so so how do we derive this figure simply I 
think we we we do the same-thing as uh what Mr ban did uh 
in uh in his research uh we take a look at the-history of 
uh us with with it's Unique uh inflation a lot of infl 
different-inflation rates over let's say 60 years or 70 
years or 50 years and each of them-they will have different 
kind of market returns depending on your different-equities 
and and and bond Bond allocations and you will be able to 
kind-of work work work work this out okay so um as more 
more and more people work on-this we can have a certain 
table like this so This is actually taken from this-very 
nice block on on this retirement income planning called 
early retirement-now so the the the the owner of that block 
is called cast Caston and he-actually showed showed this 
table and with the data from the US from 1871 to-to 20 one 
uh 161 right uh there's a lot of uh 30y year 40 year 50 
year and 60e-uh SE sequence so uh over here you can see on 
the left hand side that that uh-going down there's 
different kind of stocks allocation from 100% to 0% 
stocks-allocation okay okay and then next to it you can see 
different duration of uh how-how long you need the income 
whether it's 30 years uh to 40 years 50 years 60-years you 
you'll keep repeating and over here on the uh horizontal 
side is-different kind of safe withdrawal rate from 3% 
to-5% and this table will tell you that like what's the 
success rate uh success-rate for the income to last for 
this allocation for this duration uh if let's-say your safe 
withdrawal rate is let's say four 4% itself okay and what 
you'll-notice is if it's 100% that means that uh from this 
period 1871 to-2016 if let's let's let's take the first 
cell as an example it means that there-are a lot of 30-year 
periods over here and if your allocation is 100% stocks-one 
right if you start with let's say 3% which means that if 
you have a $1-million portfolio you start with 30,000 and 
every subsequent year you adjust by-the inflation uh the 
prevailing inflation for that sequence one right-there's 
probably like about if I my math if right about 90 90 
unique 30-year-sequence within them and 100% all of them 
will last so it kind of shows how-how robust it is because 
over the past uh this is like how how how long about-uh 150 
years uh 150 years there's a lot of things happening and 
and and uh this-this portfolio 100% Equity portfolio if 
you're spending uh so little as three 3%-of the portfolio 
it will last and if we go a lot of people like this five 
five-five 5% uh figure because if you have 1 million if you 
spend 50,000 that's kind-of a nice figure some people 
figure out that if uh they can get a dividence of-that much 
how how you'll do and you can kind of look at this figure 
to give you-a certain sensing that a uh it's not saying 
that uh if you live through with-with this plan it will not 
work it will work but if you're unlucky there are-certain 
kind of scenarios especially those High inflationary 
scenarios or-very deflationary scenarios where it won't 
work okay and this is the part-where it's kind of red in 
color you can see this 7% if you you wish this money-to 
last for 60 years and then all of your money is inside 
fixed income and-you decided to spend 5% of it run right 
there's-probably there's out of all the unique 60e sequence 
only about 7% of them-you'll be successful which means that 
there's there's not really there's-really not a lot lot of 
safety if your plan is a 0% stocks and and six 60 
years-kind kind of situation now so so if uh there's a lot 
of a lot of my friends who-who who Envision that they are 
they want to be in a 100% Equity portfolio this is-where 
you're supposed to look at okay there's different duration 
some of you-probably you w the money to last 50 60 years 
this these two these two roles are-the ones that you're 
supposed to take a look and what you notice is that 
if-let's say you keep let's say a safe withdrawal rate 
closer to let's say-three to three 3.5 % or so on right 
it's kind of it's It's kind of relatively-safe but also 
that if if you don't have to be in 100% Equity portfolio 
look at-the 70% or the 50% one they look just just as as 
good so if there's some-takeaways from from this one is is 
that if you want a plan that leans more-towards a robust 
one you're probably looking at somewhere close close 
to-three to to 3.5% now note this is when when it is-doing 
this this this uh data r one he didn't there's no cost 
within it so if-let's say your average portfolio cost is 
about-0.5% you probably have to adjust the figure a bit 
which means that if your-cost is about 0.5% per year which 
is usually my assumption then you should go-lower from 3 
minus 0.5% which is 2.5% 3.5% minus 0.5% is about 3% so you 
have-to kind kind kind of adjust that yourself okay now if 
that he also-provide another table if let's say if you wish 
to be in capital preservation-mode now a lot of you like 
like the idea to not run out of money because because-B 
basically you don't want to die with zero um it's opposite 
of of Bill Bill-Perkins book and with this safe withdrawal 
framework run right you could-also uh calculate in such a 
way that to to see whether if you want to preserve-the 
value of your portfolio in real terms one right uh what 
kind of-allocations and what kind of safe withdrawal rate 
should be be CL closer-to and so this is a part that I 
extracted from it if you look at this-one 1.0 times initial 
right it's kind kind of like showing that if your-initial 
portfolio is $1 million 1.0 * 1 it means that at the end of 
this period-whether you're testing it 30 years or 60 60 
year years one right uh you spend the-money and yet at the 
end end right you still have this $1 million in real-terms 
which means that it's this this will achieve what what what 
you want-which is which is you preserve the the income and 
yet have something to spend-so it's not like like uh if a 
strategy that that that sells the units uh Sals-units and 
sales units it doesn't preserve the capital value you just 
have-to do it in a sensible Manner and the sensible manner 
is to to to start with a-low enough income and and you can 
see that okay if it's a 100% Equity-allocations right one 
right like whether it's 3 to-3.5% the the probability is 
high if it's 96% it means that I I I think there is-like 
one or two very challenging scenarios it still-D doesn't 
cover okay uh but but it is still more this go at if your 
plan is-planning let's say $1 million you're starting with 
30,000 or 35,000 it is a-much safer plan that if let's say 
you're starting with-477,000 or $50,000 okay hopefully that 
helps so I-come to the end of uh uh this this presentation 
and uh if you have any-questions on this please leave in in 
in the comments and I'll see you in in the-next video okay
