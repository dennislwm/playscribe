he's saying that he's better than us just because he 
charges 2% so let all-the consumer judge how good is Agent 
definitely home seller has been-Gathering a lot of 
attention lately I don't feel like it's the 
most-professional in terms of like what you're saying 
online you can get cancel-quite easily you know you come 
out into the market without any experience FL a-2% fee on 
the forehead and you say you're professional does that make 
any-sense to you guys so we got a lot of so-called um hate 
comments but as they-say if that's haters that means you're 
doing something right you know-my biggest selling point is 
very simple my agent fee is 1 tri9 okay you time the-GST 
are 2178 so my highest so HB 1.31 million we time a 2% 26,2 
you time the-GST is 28,5 58 so you look at the difference 
my-owner save 26,000 on this transaction alone so that is 
my highest selling-point okay I'm Patrick Chi founder of a 
home seller my age 42 are father of-three sons I find that 
for agent to go down every single trip two and may be-one 
but the viewing may be 5 minutes so I just take away the 
viewing part uh the-rest of the thing I still provide a 
full agent Services we give this C saving-back to the 
seller by not going for the viewing you think that real 
estate-agents might not be happy about your flat fee 
structure I believe so uh if I-manage to go to a certain 
scale definitely I'll be affecting uh certain-percentage of 
the 2% agent if you don't innovate and learn as you grow 
then I-will say that yeah High chance of you being kick out 
off the real estate-industry is very high Tik Tok is 
something new to me I only started in-August 202 three then 
I have gained so much traction via Tik Tok he did call-out 
one agent for wearing flashy clothes agent trying so hard 
to justify their-High commission what I realize is they 
either driving a Ferrari or they'll be-wearing 60k of 
luxury clothes but how you choose to spend your money is up 
to-you people online always say that you know you pay 
peanut you get monkey we-have no motivation to sell high 
for our seller one guy say that you pay one tri9-he sell 
for you 500k you pay me 2% sell for you 550k the agent only 
sell a few-HB deals and then he want to compare to me when 
I sell 400 plus under CA record-then plus I do so many 
record price I just find that how can someone be so-unreal 
home seller compan with a flat fee is a disruption where it 
is actually-offering the same product at a lower price that 
resonates very well with the-hdb market I think that's good 
for empowering consumers so I have one case-in bishan help 
open the door close the deal and we s at Price the thing 
that I-can justify is you know every time I go down for the 
viewing is only the 5-minute process now I open the door 
let the buyers view this one is a corner-unit you know this 
one is facing where down there is the MRT but all 
this-information I'm thinking the buyer know I've seen him 
promoting his services-online it's a great service that 
consumers should be willing to consider-if their properties 
are be able to sell for itself but in other 
instances-whereby the house need a little more work to 
Spruce it up in order to get it-ready for sale especially 
for good price in a short time the model may 
not-necessarily work I myself have lost clients in for to 
Patrick for sure she-asked me do you think you can come 
down to meet me in terms of commission can-you do it at 
like 1% or something like that and I told her that I'm 
sorry I-can't do it I spent $300 to $600 for the video 
shoot I spent countless hours-doing all the viewing review 
and I know what kind of value I can bring to the-table so 
when you go on Prop Guru you will see listings that stand 
out to you-a bit more something that is more prominent with 
the agent pH and the-techline those are double boosts 
there's a higher chance that the buyers will-click in to 
look at your listing much much higher exposure I can tell 
you if I-take 60 days to Market a unit if I turbo all the 
way there 1.2k already yes yeah-uh recently got something I 
okay yeah okay so very because my buy my seller-went to go 
and sell view okay then same problem happened-again okay 
let let's discuss with them guys me a very interesting 
thing again-same thing happen our DIY condo buyer went to 
sell VI and then the agent to-our buyer and get his contact 
number who is that oh some-a lot agents are very hungry 
right now the maret is going down Le are getting-less and 
lesser I think we can train another type of agents to serve 
the the-buyer since we are absent they try and we we be 
present maybe another way you-can try is that before you go 
to V you just can preem the potential buyer which-is our 
seller also what is the possible scenario that you'll be 
facing-do but but still not there there solution to be 
let's brainstorm a bit-more I have attended a home seller 
viewing before and I was the buyer agent-we were left 
unguided on the property while viewing the place there were 
a lot-of questions that uh we were not actually reped to 
like past transactions-wise uh what was sold before and why 
were they sold at a certain price and we-actually ended up 
uh buying a different Home Instead although you may think 
that-the sellers are living there and they know the 
property best not being a-salesperson means that they will 
not be able to bring out the best attributes of-the 
property as an agent I feel like doing the vi are so 
important because it-allows us to bring out the best 
attributes of the house in terms of the-narratives that 
we're having with the buyer for a house such as this which 
is-currently vacant staging also plays a really important 
role to help the buyer-envisage how the house will look 
like as their home so today I have an open house-coming and 
I'm trying to make sure that the house is neat and tidy 
in-preparation for the viewers later some sellers who are 
more savy they know how-to do everything themselves on the 
other hand let's say you are 60 now you grow-up and you 
bought your first house with an agent and now you need 
somebody to-talk to you need somebody to be there and 
handhold you all the way through the-whole process there 
could also be somebody who is a extreme high flyer-whose 
time is the most valuable asset that they have I rather 
give you the-keys you handle all the viewing request with 
the tenant manage everything for me-I just sign the paper 
when I need to come down my channel is called house-hunt 
with you which means to say that I am looking at things 
from a buyer's-perspective I had people coming up to me 
saying it's not nice to say this about-certain development 
because there are people out there who are trying to 
sell-that I have been asked to take down certain content as 
well but I have stood-by my my freedom of speech in this 
case is funny because many agents has been-just doing own 
Tik Tok countless there's a law under EA that you have to 
run what-you post online right through your agency first 
everything that means every-single before it post you say 
hi can not then you post they try to complain-Patrick on 
that uh then then in a sense CA have because once it's a 
formal-complaint they have to do a obligatory investigation 
with this uh video I'm-effectively terminated with 
immediate effect since last night 17 of f 2235-hours I was 
invited by ca for interview then after that I was being 
served the-termination but I cannot practice as a I so I 
comply with the ca rules and-regulation I don't practice I 
pass all my stuff to my team to handle I was-there for 5 
hours with CA so oh for real you also I was also going 
support-interview Patrick asked me um I say I'm Not Afraid 
who did nothing wrong I do-understand that there are a lot 
of agents who are unhappy about what home-seller is doing 
but I don't feel like anyone should be in that position 
to-have to answer to everybody just because they're out 
there to disrupt the market-patri is origin very 
controversial guy he speak his mind most people 
don't-really confront us like hey I don't like you but they 
they wish in their hearts-that oh no maybe go business then 
we can continue become very very censored-sometimes so we 
cannot we cannot say a lot of things already because people 
are-always out there to try to now know social media is on 
but as they say if-there haters that means that means 
you're doing something right you know so-now we are just 
full force running so the after you agencies then there's 
no-restriction and also investigation concluded by CA 
nothing wrong we never-do much I've been in this for 9 
years I've been through the top few agencies-like brn ra 
and hton it works like MLM as well the top recruiter 
recruit a lot-of downlines I think the whole com structure 
overall is a b inflated uh-especially for those who are not 
so experienced yeah people see to feel that-all the agents 
are earning $1 million a year if you are actually within 
like-200k 300K a year it puts you probably on top of the 
top 20% of agents in-Singapore already I make close to 10K 
a month sometimes I can have absolutely no-income at all I 
do not have invested money I have to borrow from credit 
card-I'm asking myself why am I doing all these things so 
when the first year come-so there's a time when I think 
that you know I just do it slowly bit by bit I-operate on a 
lowc cost model so a lot of people question is how can we 
sustain-selling my volume sounds like a good idea but I'm 
always on the phone now 247-now I got five people messaging 
me then yesterday I was doing four negotiations-so we are 
trying very hard now to try to keep it affordable okay uh 
but again-example of this model you ear to little right 
maybe the fix rate will start to-become higher today I'm 
here going to meet this-a new owner at this campus video I 
have not met this owner before so I'm here to-find out how 
we can assist them to sell their unit at a good price so we 
need to-do some Financial calculation how do you find out 
to-internet and some unhappy agents for talking to us about 
it I also you guys-so it's to all those agent that refer us 
negative marketing is-marketing any doubts about can 
explain to you more about how we from the basic-information 
I found on internet is that the difference between you and 
other-agencies probably is that doing Wings you guys won't 
be around actually it's-still a full agent services so uh 
we'll do everything for you like what you-mentioned is 
correct uh when we tell you example today 6 p.m. there a 
buyer-coming to view so someone must be at home to open a 
door for the buyers so-after the Buy VI uh they left with 
full with them for feedbacks and whether they-want to me 
offer I can say I'm proud to be a real estate AG now under 
home-seller yeah I very bro take my job you take for me I 
by by two two months-you'll die already I'll say it's more 
than just the money at least I help to-build something 
bigger potentially 30 years down the road this whole 
industry-will disappear agents will disappear hdb just 
launched the htb resale flat-listing Auto the people who 
are 13 now they don't really need agents if they-are very 
savy they know how to do everything themselves I don't 
think the-value of agent will truly disappear so in this 
case with the resale portal-being put up it actually allows 
us to identify genuine listings and take-advantage of 
technology to do things better faster I think we can see 
from-all the videos all the content currently they always 
say I have a lot of value-but they never say put in 
pinpoint form what is my value just like how we 
home-sellers say our value I say my 1 N is a full agent 
Services no one has ever come-out to say that I say the 
wrong thing or I give a misleading advertisement I hope-to 
see that Singapore real estate Market does get a bit more 
open and transparent-where people are actually looking to 
cob broke be more friendly and prioritize-their clients 
needs before their I have C with a lot of Agents we are 
working-fine together what I want to say about Property 
agent talking about me on Tik-Tok I would say that I went 
through so many failure so I'm mentally strong in-such a 
way you R me I still can do other thing as a Property agent 
yourself you-need to innovate you need to find way to sell 
yourself just remember you're not-selling the property 
you're selling yourself-[Music]
