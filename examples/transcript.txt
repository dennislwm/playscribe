all it's buffering rather slowly sorry just one-moment no I 
think it's streaming welcome uh welcome everyone I'm Sid 
CEO at-gitlab and this is our ask me anything opportunity 
for new hires thanks you all-for joining gitlab ail you 
want to kick us-off sure I'd love to thank you for the 
opportunity by the way for all of us new-hires to get to 
know more about you and the company um I dropped a 
couple-questions the first one is as you very well know 
gitlab recently releas-released our fiscal year 2024 ESG 
report um I've linked this to the document if-anyone wants 
to read on that further and I'm curious if there is 
anything within-that report that the company is working on 
that you are particularly proud-of I think um one statistic 
that I'm very proud of is that we have uh not-only a lot of 
women in uh who who joined us as individual contributors 
it's about-40% but also women in leadership is about 40% as 
well then recently I'm-impressed with how fast sharid and 
the purchasing team have-been able to uh kind of change our 
purchasing to-uh purchase more from under represented 
groups that was great-thank you I love to hear that I 
appreciate-that um if it's okay I guess I'll dive into the 
next question then then we'll-jump to the next team member 
does that sound okay yeah go for it perfect so the-second 
question I have is you know it appears that gitlab has 
definitely-prioritized creating meaningful connections 
between members team members-not only in person but also 
virtually um and I appreciate that since we are a-remote 
company I'd love to hear if you think that um specifically 
these Summits-and iners opportunities for departments to 
get together do you foresee these-continuing to remain a 
priority for future years or do you think that at any-point 
we might shift a little bit more towards virtual um 
Gatherings as teams-yeah thanks for asking and um-um I see 
them as still kind of professional connections they're 
your-co-workers after all and the the the the lingo we try 
to use or I try to use is-informal communication it's kind 
of yeah getting to know someone as a person-which you're 
probably alluding to um and and go know more about kind of 
the-person behind the coworker I think that's essential to 
build trust and we-use both uh virtual events and in person 
events to do that I think with inperson-events you can do 
things that are much harder uh otherwise I'm thinking 
of-sharing a meal together um and conferences where kind if 
you very-quickly alternate who's speaking and and finish 
each other sentences with a new-group that's tougher to do 
in the zoom meeting we're really good at doing-things from 
Motu we have like 15 plus suggestions how to organize a 
virtual-event to help with informal communication-um but I 
I really see added value to the inperson to the iners is 
just expensive-both in time and money so we should always 
kind of try to-do the maximum remote that we can and then 
use the in the iners for stuff-that's uniquely within iners 
thank you thank you-too oh question question number three 
can you-help me here yes this is chia friend engineer and 
crazy theage source code-this morning I'm one-onone with my 
manager for having your name as the zoom-title yes uh this 
morning I went on with my manager I learned the stories of 
Team-Member One so back in 2017 uh the the nightmare 
happened to an engineer-working here it will be a nightmare 
for anyone um the story is also linked in-that post but 
essentially um the person executed command was able to drop 
some-tables in PR we lost about six hours of data um it's a 
very touching story and-uh I guess like for in the spirit 
of transparent and sharing fail failure uh-can you share a 
mistake or failure that you learned from-Recently thanks 
for the question uh I don't know so so many-um yesterday 
I-um apologize to one of to two team member because in the 
performance review-of that person I was very focused on the 
future-and what uh what could be better and what 
my-expectations were but I didn't focus on the year that 
was passed and all the-extraordinary things that person had 
done-and um yeah-the it's I'm always I'm always 
hopefully-looking into the future U and that's what we're 
here for we're working to-make things better but really 
important to acknowledge the great work people do-and I 
kind of dropped a ball on that and when I reread what I 
wrote I was like oh-I can't believe believe I missed uh 
these these big achievements that the-person did so that's 
that's the first example that-comes to mind but I I kind of 
have a a mistake more days than-not thank you for that 
thanks for the question anybody else there who wants to-ask 
something on the public stream should I just chime in can 
you hear me-okay yeah go ahead Alex um so I've been really 
pleased with uh the sort of-Community Focus and 
environmental Focus that really feels like the core of 
the-company at gitlab like it's a software company but it 
it feels to me as a as a-new employee like it really 
matters to the company that uh that-we're inclusive and 
that we're being good stewards of the environment 
and-things like that not just an afterthought however large 
companies-tend to change hands tend to evolve um you know 
recently gitlab became a-publicly traded company do you 
have thoughts on how to ensure that those-values that make 
gitlab so special to me um continue as the company grows 
and-changes yeah yeah thanks for that um a good question I 
I-have although like we care about the environment as a 
company I don't think-it's it's one of the uh the first 
things that come to-mind like we in our top values results 
for customers and then in our values we-have diversity 
inclusion and belowing that's super important to me that 
people-feel included and welcome here um-the as a software 
company we have-less kind of direct um things we can 
influence in the-environment and there are some things that 
actually make us a bigger impact on-the environment because 
we hire people in so many countries and then we bring-them 
for example together for Summit we we CA a lot of aircraft 
pollution and-things like that so that's a tougher subject 
um I think-we uh we see a role for every company to kind of 
try to compensate carbon-emissions and things like that but 
I think for the rest I think it's hard to-do things within 
y lab um I think-I sorry I found it easier to do things 
outside of-gitl um I'll get all-my it's okay if I get all 
my little Soap Box what I do outside of gitl help 
with-these things-absolutely so regarding like environment 
is many things but the the the biggest-thing that comes to 
mind is climate change I think the biggest way to 
combat-that is uh renewable energy production and the way 
to do that is solar and the-biggest way we can make solar 
better in my view is for off skyed solar cells-that are 
more affordable to Manufactured more efficient flexible and 
lighter-weight and the best us Solar Company is Swift-solar 
um a couple of years ago I let one of-their rounds couple 
weeks ago I did a full day board-meeting uh with them 
that's the first time I did a full day Bard meeting 
not-even at gitlab do we do that but it was well organized 
and Joel did a great job-bringing people together um but 
I'm really excited about-the potential they can have and I 
think if they are-successful then we can build more solar 
than we-need in the summer problem with solar 
it's-intermittent I think batteries can solve the day night 
cycle but we'll have to-overbuild for the summer by a 
factor of three to have enough in the-winter um but that 
means also during a huge-part of the year the other three 
non-winter seasons will have more than-enough electricity 
and there's great companies like terraform that are 
trying-to make inefficient that affordable electrolyzers to 
do something useful-with that so terraform is a company 
terraform industri is a company I'm-looking forward to 
diving into to seeing how they're-doing but uh yeah so I I 
think we're doing what we can uh-within G lab but I'm I'm 
also really excited what we can do outside of-gitlab feel 
free to share like what what you-think we're doing okay as 
a as a company what we maybe could be doing but aren't-of 
to get your take uh I've already um taken I've only-been 
here for a month but I've already taken my first couple of 
steps into um-thinking about off you know Carbon offsets 
for uh Duo and and such there's-been some some people have 
been very uh helpful with uh directing me to where I-should 
share my thoughts um I don't have any I-don't have any 
Earth shaking ideas but I'm really I think my the main 
thing I-have to say about the company is the fact that it's 
even mentioned and that-anyone is even thinking about it is 
really uh special to me among all of the-other for-profit 
companies I've worked for um my original background was 
in-nonprofit environmental activism so I worked there 10 
years before I went to-for-profits so um I'm I'm impressed 
even even though you say it's not a core part-of the 
company it's still more than most what I appreciate that I 
agree that-carbon offsets is is is one of the things we can 
do and uh you'll find-other people get lab hopefully 
equally passionate I know that stenh who our one-of our 
fellows is is very passionate about this as-well thank you 
thank you anybody else for the public stream
