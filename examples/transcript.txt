[Music] so i believe-that we're all only given one precious 
life-for those of us who are really lucky to be born-it's a 
life to be embraced a life to be used for good and a 
life-that's worth prolonging in good health-now when we're 
all very young we assume that our parents and our 
grandparents-all our loved ones will be around forever-but 
then we learn that that's not true i clearly remember-my 
daughter madeline here she is when she was four years old i 
was-putting her to bed and she said daddy will you always 
be-around to protect me man at uh even almost brings a tear 
to-my eye right now it's i think anyone who's been a parent 
knows how this how-this feels and i said to her i had to be 
honest i said i'm i'm sorry-one day like everybody i will 
grow old and i-will die and i watched her eyes well up-and 
she gave me a really big hug but then i told her i think 
what we all-tell our children which is just don't think 
about it-and so she did but here's my my big idea i think 
we've-all done this in our lives we all try to forget about 
this truth-and ironically i believe this is preventing us 
from re realizing-the lives we could actually live so you 
know my grandmother-vera she's an amazing lady-she saved 
lives in world war ii she escaped persecution from hungary 
and-fled to australia she had a wonderful sense of humor 
a-love of life and uh she spent a lot of time raising-me 
and she never wanted me to call her-grandma only vera 
because she hated the idea of growing-old but since then 
i've watched her grow old-she's watched herself grow old 
too and she used to apologize to me for it-a few months ago 
i uh i heard that she she fell over in her apartment and 
she-broke the top of her femur she went straight to 
hospital they-operated on her her heart stopped in the 
operation and-i arrived in sydney with my son then five 
years old to say goodbye to her she-was there just a shell 
of the woman she once was-she had a feeding tube coming out 
her nose-she barely knew who anybody was and i thought this 
thing we call aging-why aren't we up in arms about it-and 
this this once vibrant woman reduced to this-it's 
incredible and this is just my story but this is-being 
played out every day in everybody's family it's certainly 
not an-isolated case in fact i don't want to be a downer 
but-this or something like it is going to happen to all our 
loved ones including-all of us and that's actually the best 
case-scenario so why aren't we doing more about it-well i 
think we all know that aging is important-for example the 
world health organization recently put out a report-32 page 
reports saying that aging is one of the biggest-problems of 
our generation-unless we do something to keep the elderly 
healthy and productive-the cost is going to crush national 
infrastructures and our way of life our-economies are going 
to fall-and this is what the governments are saying-but 
what you may not realize is a fraction of just one percent 
of-medical research is devoted to understanding why we 
age-and even less is devoted to trying to do something 
about it-and this to me is a major puzzle-what i think is 
going on is that we just don't like to think about it-it's 
really quite weird i noticed many of you chuckled when i 
was introduced-i think we're just inbuilt ingrained to to 
really not want to talk about it we-feel uncomfortable 
embarrassed talking about extending lifespan and 
delaying-aging for many people it's even sacrilegious-i 
once debated the bioethics advisor to president george w 
bush on national-radio his point to the audience and to me 
was-aging is natural it's part of the way of life in fact 
it-makes life worth living what a load of bull-alzheimer's 
heart disease cancer these are natural-and we do everything 
we can to prevent and slow these diseases down-99 percent 
of medical research is devoted-to trying to slow down these 
diseases which actually-only a fraction of us actually get 
whereas aging-if we're lucky affects all of us so you might 
ask well why don't we just-continue what we're doing why 
don't we just study individual diseases that's-what we've 
always done it seems pretty good-but what you may not know 
is that the rate-of aging is actually-decreasing what i 
mean by that-is that we've developed many medicines that 
actually-can treat part of our body say our hearts we're 
very good at keeping our-hearts healthy but our brains 
still age okay-so what we've ended up with are-and just to 
use my grandmother as an example-a nation of elderly whose 
hearts are working well for example but their-brains are no 
longer functioning and this is a major problem for our 
health-care system it's extremely extremely expensive-what 
we need are medicines that will keep all of our bodies 
parts working-at the same time and if we just if we just 
fix one part-of our body the problem is that some other 
part will break down-we're just switching out diseases and 
i don't think this is the right way-to go about it if you 
look at this graph actually this-really brings it home now 
we're always taught that our-medicines are making us 
healthier for longer that's not true look at this-graph the 
amount of time that we are spending in good health 
is-actually decreasing in terms of percentage-no wonder 
health care costs are going up what we need to do of course 
is to keep-us healthier for longer so i'm not talking about 
living for 500-years i see that sometimes quoted in the 
press but what i am talking about-is an ability for us to 
live into our 90s and our hundreds in a healthy way-and not 
like my grandmother who suffers and many of us will go 
through this-unless we do something about the root cause of 
aging and i would argue is the-greatest problem of our time 
well let me tell you about the work that-i've been doing a 
little bit about how i think we can-get at the root cause 
of aging so when i was in my 20s i earned a phd-in sydney 
and i headed off to boston-to a place called mit to 
understand why yeast cells little budding yeast that we-use 
to make bread and beer why they grow old because i figured 
if we couldn't-figure this this out for a yeast cell we had 
no hope of understanding why we grow-old fortunately i did 
and even though there-were critics of this approach the 
critics that were even nobel prize-winners who who told me 
uh you know this is not the-way to go about aging yeast 
cells don't get gray hair they don't get heart-disease they 
don't get cancer but i ignored them fortunately i was-quite 
naive um-luckily and we in the next few years what we 
discovered as a group was that-yeast cells do in fact grow 
old and one of the reasons is that their genes start-to 
switch on as they get older so what i mean by that is that 
so every-cell has a set number of genes we all know that-in 
every one of your cells same number of genes but they're 
not all switched on-at the same time they need to be kept 
on and off and tell-what type of cell is in the liver and 
what type of cell is in the brain-what we found was these 
yeast cells as they got older after about a week-all the 
genes started to come on and they died-now we could find 
genes that could actually slow that process down we 
could-find genes that could switch off those rogue genes 
and silence them and this-led to a discovery of a longevity 
gene called sir two and sir two stands for-silent 
information regulator number two-so in 1999 i started a a 
new lab at harvard medical school-i was 29 and figured i 
could change the world it was-really exciting we soon 
discovered that there are seven of these longevity genes-in 
our bodies we call these the sirtuins so the sirtuins have 
risen to scientific-prominence there's thousands of papers 
on these now-and what we've learned is that they seem to 
protect our body against diseases of-aging so for example 
if you put extra copies-of these genes into yeast and 
little nematode worms and-flies and mice they do a lot 
better in fact in most-cases they live longer in a healthy 
state-so what we need to do is to figure out ways to tweak 
these genes-to make them more active and in that way we 
might be able to delay-all the diseases that we get as we 
get older and possibly even reverse aging-so let me explain 
what the serptoons do in our body and i have uh i've been 
very-fortunate that the the tedx people have helped me make 
some videos here-there's a new idea about aging and that is 
that-as we get older genes are switched on and off in the 
wrong way so when we're-young there's a beautiful symphony 
playing but as we get older-the instruments the orchestra 
starts to play willy-nilly and screw things up-so if we 
zoom into the cell you'll see a chromosome and if we 
stretch out the-chromosome that's the dna all twirled up 
there in gray-the pink blobs are proteins called histones 
that the dna is packaged in-red means the gene is off the 
problem during aging is that-chemicals come in and stick to 
the histones-and turn the genes on so that's what the green 
lights mean this gene that should-be off in the brain of my 
grandmother is now coming on-and that's a terrible thing if 
this gene will happen happen to be a-gene that told the 
liver to be a liver cell and now it's on in the brain 
you-can imagine the problem and that's what we think-may be 
a large part of what happens during aging-this leads to a 
really important possibility-we used to think that 
mutations these irreversible changes to our dna are 
what-cause aging but in fact if it's this this what we call 
an epigenetic change-that's reversible so let me show you 
how we can reverse it-so these are two ones they actually 
make proteins that i'm-going to show a cartoon of it's 
going to look like a pacman-and what the sortun proteins do 
in our body is that they clip off-these chemical groups see 
and now the gene that was on in the old-person green goes 
off again-and that's what the serotonins are doing in our 
bodies right now-they're stimulated naturally when we don't 
eat-and when we exercise and if we eat a large hamburger-we 
shut them down again this is not good so what we wanted to 
do is to to find a-way to turn the system on find a 
molecule that could be taken in a little-pill and turn on 
these sort of enzymes and-then we thereby we could clip off 
these chemical groups and-keep these diseases of aging at 
bay and keep our whole body healthy-we might even one day 
in theory-reverse aspects of aging so as i said i was in 
boston and uh-things were looking really interesting i 
started a company that was based on-the discovery that 
there were molecules that could activate these enzymes-the 
one ten years ago that we found which got a lot of media 
attention-was from red wine it's called resveratrol-and uh 
don't ask me to say that again that's a-hard word 
resveratrol and so resveratrol as you've probably-you've 
probably heard is in red wine now the problem with that is 
that you'd need-to drink about 100 glasses of red wine a 
day-no i don't recommend that don't do that but-but what we 
clearly needed was a drug that would do this something 
that's more-effective more potent than resveratrol and this 
company they raised a lot of-money and they set to find 
molecules that were-even better than resveratrol they found 
ones that were 100 times more-potent than the red wine 
molecule-they put them into animals and these animals i'm 
talking about mice they were-much healthier they didn't get 
heart disease they they-were protected against alzheimer's 
that protected against cancer it was-extremely exciting 
they even started human trials and the-molecules appeared 
safe and there were already hints just little-hints that 
actually these molecules were working the same way as 
resveratrol was-working to prevent these diseases of 
aging-so at that point everything looked great i thought 
the world is going to be-different in my lifetime we don't 
have to worry this is gonna work out-and then the bottom 
fell out what happened was-a few years ago the world's 
largest pharmaceutical company-put out a scientific paper 
that said that all of this science-was wrong dead wrong 
that resveratrol did not-work on these proteins in fact 
another group said that certains-had nothing to do with 
aging it was a really-depressing time of my life i had 
emails from top scientists sending-me condolences the 
clinical trials were put on on hold-i thought i'd let my 
lab down i thought i'd let australia down i thought i'd 
let-the whole world down and there were days where i really 
just-wanted to quit being a scientist but the good news-was 
the silver lining was that it forced us-in the lab to go 
back and really understand how did resveratrol and 
these-other synthetic drugs actually work so i pulled 
together a group of-scientists there were about 30 of us 
and we set to work to understand-what was true and what 
we've discovered-is that resveratrol really does bind to 
that pac-man-and sticks on the back of it and makes it 
chomp fast faster-and that is how they all work we were 
surprised we didn't realize that-residual and these drugs 
all work the same way but they do it was amazing-and so the 
clinical trials have started up again and i'm hopeful that 
one day-hopefully not in the too distant future there will 
be medicines-that we can take say a little pill i've got an 
example of what it might look-like we might take one of 
these with-breakfast and that could ward off the diseases 
of-aging until much later and keep us healthier and 
functioning-so i really look forward to a day when this 
happens and when it does i i-believe that we're going to 
look back at today like we do-people from 100 years ago 
when people would die from an infected-splinter which in 
those days as you might recall-was perfectly natural and i 
not only believe that we have a-right to use this new 
technology to help ourselves and our loved ones i 
believe-we have a duty a financial and an ethical one-and 
if you don't believe me just ask any four-year-old-thank 
you very much [Applause]-[Music] you
