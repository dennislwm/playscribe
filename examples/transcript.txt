do you want to talk real quick about medicine 1.0 2.0 3.0 
so medicine 1.0 is-the type of medicine that dominated for 
virtually all of human existence so if-we you know if we 
argue that humans have been around you know Homo sapiens 
have-been around about 250,000 years from from the arrival 
of our species until-the latter part of the 19th century um 
we were practicing this thing called-medicine 1.0 which 
truthfully wasn't medicine in the way that we think 
about-it today it wasn't scientific in the way that we 
understand science today it was-the best that humans could 
do missing this tool right missing this tool of-inference 
and you know it relied on a belief about you know perhaps 
Gods-Spirits humors um and so you know it to be just blunt 
was largely ineffective-um and so you know the the doctor 
of the past didn't have any tools in large part-because 
they didn't have any understanding of what was going on 
in-terms of disease processes so not surprisingly humans uh 
didn't live that-long on average uh and you know the median 
life expectancy would have been-into the late 30s or early 
40s um the causes of death were typically related-to 
communicable diseases uh infections and and death 
Associated um-with child mortality and um maternal 
mortality so just the process of having-a baby was 
incredibly dangerous to both the mother and the baby um and 
obviously-that heavily skews lifespan data if you're 
killing young mothers and babies-in the process of having 
babies you're really bringing down lifespan and 
life-expectancy and couple that with infections 
communicable diseases and-Trauma um and you know I think 
most people aren't surprised to know that yep-that's pretty 
much how people died um and then of course after the after 
you-know the Civil War and we we move into the latter part 
of the 19th century a-couple of things start to come 
together now the first of these actually happened-in the 
17th century um but it wouldn't become gerine to Medicine 
until 300-years later um or 2 200 years later rather and 
that was Francis Bacon-codifying the scientific method so 
again this is something you we take for-granted today but 
this idea that you would make an observation which is 
what-science is All About You observe something around you 
you observe-something in the natural world you form a 
hypothesis about why it is-happening you design an 
experiment that is equipped to test the-hypothesis you 
conduct the experiment and measure the outcome and you 
compare-the results of the experiment to the prediction of 
the hypothesis and that is-effectively the framework for 
what science is and so with that as the-scaffolding upon 
which people could begin to make inference you now layer 
on-some other remarkable discoveries and insights so a 
creation of the light-microscope the Advent of germ Theory 
and ultimately the-development of antimicrobial agents all 
of these things collectively I think I-would add to that 
just the practice of Sanitation led to a remarkable change 
in-the trajectory of human lifespan um and of course it's 
so-remarkable that if you go from the late 1800s until you 
know fast forward just-100 years which again is a sliver of 
time across a 250,000 year timeline-human lifespan approx 
imately doubled um so you know again 3 four 
five-generations to double human lifespan that had 
previously been unchanged for-hundreds of Generations is a 
remarkable feat and we call this new system of-medicine 
medicine 2.0 now there's lots of more Nuance to-get into 
medicine 2.0 uh medicine 2.0 ultimately developed even 
more-remarkable statistical tools that allowed for things 
called random-controlled experiments or rcts randomized 
control trials and this-really allowed medicine 2.0 to 
flourish and become-supercharged and um obviously for the 
most part medicine 1.0 was completely-displaced by this now 
that doesn't mean that there aren't still some quacks 
out-there that practice witchcraft but for the most part um 
you know when a person-has an infection when a person has 
congestive heart failure when a person-is in renal failure 
when a person has appendicitis and needs to have 
their-appendix remove when a woman has a complicated 
pregnancy all of these-things now for people who are in the 
developed world are really easy things-to manage using the 
toolkit of medicine 2.0 so again medicine 2.0 was 
and-remains an enormous success and I certainly wouldn't be 
sitting here-talking with medicine 2.0 I would likely have 
been dead already uh as would you-have so why do we need to 
go any further why do we need a medicine 3.0 well for-all 
of the successes of medicine 2.0 it has indeed had a couple 
of obvious and-notable failures um the most obvious is 
that-lifespan has largely faltered so there really has not 
been any extension of-lifespan beyond that which came from 
the-eradication of the conditions that led to the demise of 
most people uh between-the Civil War and the end of the 
first world-war um in particular the types of diseases that 
kill people today uh are-very different types of diseases 
from those that killed people 150 years ago-so the bading 
causes of death which I describe as the Four Horsemen of 
death-uh are are the diseases of atherosclerosis so um 
coronary artery-disease and cerebral vascular disease 
cancer the neurodegenerative diseases-and dementing 
diseases uh so Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease 
Louis body-dementia vascular dementia frontal temporal 
dementia all of those diseases-and then these slew of 
metabolic diseases that while directly not-responsible for 
an enormous number of lives lost compared to the 
other-categories uh indirectly contri immensely by 
amplifying all of these now-there's a couple of other 
things I haven't mentioned there at the-population level 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is also an 
enormous-cause of death um but its cause is almost 
exclusively related to cigarette-smoking so I don't really 
hold medicine 2.0 particularly responsible for the-failure 
of mitigating that that's really more of a public health 
question um if-people don't smoke they don't get COPD even 
though COPD is one of the leading-causes of death um there 
are of course accidental deaths um and we can spend-some 
time talking about those later because there's an enormous 
spread of-what those look like across lifespan and of 
course by geography-so in essence the purpose of medicine 
3.0 is to try to address where medicine-2.0 has fallen 
short it's not to replace medicine-2.0 um I certainly from 
time to time um hear-feedback from people who I think 
misunderstand the arguments I've tried-to lay out and uh 
there there's nowhere that I'm suggesting that we need to 
do-away with medicine 2.0 that we don't want the system as 
it exists today in-its capacity to do what it can do what I 
argue is that we need to shift-resources away from solely 
focusing on medicine 2.0 to focusing on what we'll-talk 
about in a minute which is medicine 3.0 so if we're putting 
a 100 units of-resources today into medicine 2.0 I think 
most economists would argue-that's still too many units of 
of economic input in other words Healthcare-makes up far 
too big a section of the economy so maybe instead of it 
being a-100 units that go into Healthcare it really ought 
to be closer to 60 units-that go into Healthcare and I 
would argue further maybe 30 of those unit-units should be 
aimed towards medicine 3.0 and 30 of those units should 
be-aimed towards medicine 2.0 because when it hits the fan 
and something goes-really wrong you know again trauma 
infection Heart Attack by all means you-want medicine 2.0 
there to back stop those things but medicine 3.0 job is 
to-make those encounters with medicine 2.0 less frequent 
less severe and later in-life so that is effectively the 
difference the the the the the final-point I'll make on 
that is kind of just briefly explaining what medicine 3.0 
is-which is because at this point it's self-evident it 
almost doesn't need to-be explained medicine 3.0 really has 
two main Hallmarks uh the first is that it-is aimed at 
preventing rather than treating chronic disease by acting 
early-acting aggressively and tailoring the therapy to the 
individuals based on the-best available evidence which is 
not necessarily going to be derivable from-randomized 
control trials and the second pillar of medicine-3.0 is 
that Health span is to be given at least as much effort and 
attention as-lifespan this is again another enormous 
difference between medicine 2.0 and-Medicine 3.0 medicine 
2.0 does not Place emphasis on health span its emphasis 
on-health span is anywhere from zero to very small 
depending on the subs-specialty so there are there are 
certainly some Physicians whose-practices do take them a 
little bit into the arena of Health span but um you 
know-outside of for example Physicians uh or healthc care 
providers who work-specifically in the arena of mental 
health again it's relatively low-obviously orthopedic 
surgery is a is a is a you know a discipline of 
medicine-that is more squarely uh featured in the health 
span Arena but for the most part-most of the healthcare 
dollars are spent on addressing uh and trying to 
elongate-lifespan um and I would argue that we need to be 
you know putting just as much-effort into Health span so 
that's that's the fundamental difference between-medicine 
3.0 2.0 and 1.0 [Music]-no
