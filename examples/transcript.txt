hey good morning family I'm excited to be with y'all today 
I uh I have a word-for you I'm trying not to cry through 
the whole-thing and the Lord the Lord visited me last 
last-night sorry I'm going to get it together cuz I've got 
a message for-you help me Holy Spirit okay all right get it 
together-here I had a visitation an open-eyed Vision 
that-lasted for about an hour the Lord showed me a-lot 
what's to come God help God help-everyone um he told me to 
do two-videos he said I want you to separate it and don't 
do it all at-once so I'll give you part and one and 
part-two but I'm going to give you the last of it-first 
because it was holy the the way he the for whenever he 
appeared Jesus-appeared the first of it was about the 
economy and-uh what's coming more about what's coming 
financially for for for you-people uh and and then the last 
of it was was his-heart is a cry for the Lost so I'm going 
to start with it-there in this Vision I saw the sun 
going-down and the spirit of the Lord said to me he 
said-Brandon the Sun is setting on on on this dispensation 
of-time he said every everything that Humanity has been 
this part of it is-coming to an end the dispensation of 
Grace is coming to an end and we're-going you're going go 
they're going into the tribulation the tribulation is 
about-to begin and I saw the sun going down and-it was just 
right where it was getting ready to set and I could see the 
sun-coming through the clouds and it was beautiful but 
there was-no time everything was was was was Timeless okay 
the way it felt like there-was no like you know when you 
feel your life is moving but it was just a PE it-was just 
like what I'm trying to say is every day we feel our 
emotions we do-everything but it was just a total peace I 
could see the beautiful colors-coming through everything 
was so I could see the beautiful colors-coming through and 
everything was so beautiful and then all of a sudden 
Jesus-stood there and he had this beautiful robe on-I've 
never seen him wear it before in any visitation that 
I've-had it was beautiful it had a a white thread that was 
perfect right here-and it went into another kind of like he 
had a garment underneath it but he had a-robe on top of it 
and it was a hood and it was it had white around the-top 
and it was it was uh it was all kinds of different like 
embroideries-like colors from like I've never seen 
before-like tapestry you know it looked like tapestry and 
um he had a huge wooden-staff in his right hand and it went 
from from from the ground all the way up into-the sky like 
like right you know above his head not sky but above his 
head and-it was it was thick real thick looking staff and 
he and and his-face had so much compassion and all of a 
sudden I heard-him say he said one last-call One Last Call 
I'm calling my-sheep I'm coming I'm coming one last call he 
said out of his-mouth and it sounded like a horn blowing 
throughout this Valley and I looked upon-this Valley and 
there was Valley of sheep all on this green-pasture but 
half of it was green but half of it was-dark and all of 
these sheep that were were were the closest to him CU he 
was-upon a hill and the sun was setting on time the the sun 
was setting and it was-it was coming to an end everything 
that we've known-everything we've ever we've ever had as 
Humanity from the beginning when Adam-and Eve all the way 
to where we are are right now he said the Sun is setting 
on-time and he said to me he said Brandon he said one 
last-call he yelled it and all of a sudden down that Valley 
the sun started to-shine upon the Sheep there was Heavy 
sheep with big big fur there was skinny-sheep that would 
looked like they had been sheared and they were completely 
no-fur they were just bald looking sheep and they were 
grazing Upon This-Grass and all of a sudden they looked to 
him the Sheep did and they started to ba-ba ba and they 
started to run to the father and he was waiting on-them the 
heavy sheep was running but I it was interesting because I 
could see-their legs and they were almost like a at a trot 
like as fast as you could a-Gallop like you're Galloping 
trying to get to the-father some of the sheep were waddling 
they were waddling cuz they were heavier-than others some 
sheep were were were like barely moving they were 
barely-trying to get there they looked like they were 
having a hard time but they-were they were on their way and 
I could see the ones-behind his face was like he was not he 
was like longing I don't want to use-words that that that 
but it was like he was distressed like the Lord could 
see-them but they weren't watching they had gray fur and 
they had-black on them the sheep that were behind here they 
were in the darkness and they-were there was grass and they 
were eating but they never heard him call One-Last Call 
they weren't paying attention they-just kept eating time 
was running out and they didn't-even know it those sheep 
were were covered in like-a soot they were covered in black 
and they were all grazing upon the-land but but but and I 
just kept watching I just kept watching his face-and he 
kept looking and he was looking to see if they were going 
to hear him as-he's calling because we're running out 
of-time we're running out of time Humanity as we know it is 
coming to an-end Humanity as as as as it's been for the 
last 6,000 years before we go into-the millennial Reign 
we're fixing to go into we're going to go into 
the-tribulation and that's what he was trying to 
tell-everybody was that there was one last call one last 
Harvest one last push and-I told you all this before that 
that the bells will ring in the church one more-time to 
sound the alarm of his coming now he's giving me this he 
come to me-personally and he told me to tell you that 
there's one last call if you you're-living on the edge and 
you you're not living for Jesus that that that boat is-your 
boat ready are you ready for the coming of the Lord are 
your is your-heart ready for the coming of your king if 
you're not and you're riding the-fence you better get your 
heart right before him because you're about to miss-the 
boat it's all the the the the Sun is-setting the Sun is 
setting and people are asleep some of them were awake 
and-they were looking for their for the for the for the 
Lord those sheep were were-attentive and they heard his 
voice because the Bible says my sheep will-know my voice 
and a stranger's voice they'll not follow one last-call and 
I and I saw I saw that sun setting and it went down-down 
and all of a sudden this is the end of the vision whenever 
I was there with-the father I've never seen this before 
in-the spirit realm whenever I'm looking over I could see 
the sun coming down-over over just all over and the light 
shined directly into my spiritual eyes-and I could not see 
anything else and it was just fire all over-me and and then 
the sun set and it went away the vision instantaneously 
stopped-and the Lord started to to tell me he said I want 
you to tell my people that-there's one more call Brandon 
there's one more call and I'm and I'm-coming I'm giving him 
one more chance I'm trying to get a great harvest of-souls 
I he he was he was warning the people that he's coming and 
and and-praying over praying over Israel praying over over 
the things that he's showing-me that's coming and um a 
great-shaking I know it's not a word in the English 
vocabulary to say shaking a-shaking but a great shaking is 
coming more than what anybody-realizes people people are 
not prepared for what's about to happen and the Lord-said 
Brandon it's time you have to get your boat ready even more 
separate-yourself unto me he said it's time for for the 
people he he showed me people in-YouTube he showed me 
people that I have known he said Brandon they'll be 
broke-within a day they're going to lose everything because 
their heart is not-with me they feel that they are he said 
but these people and he showed them all-to me and he said 
to me he said Brandon every single one of them will be 
humbled-every single one of them will lose it that fast 
everything that they've ever-had and everything he said 
because Brandon my heart is not that any man-should perish 
but all come to repentance but sometimes we go through-hard 
times because we're too stiff-necked we are not listening 
we're not watching we're not waiting we're not-having our 
lamps full keeping him Forefront in in in first place 
making-him Lord over your life he's second maybe third you 
don't consult them at-all sometimes you go to church 
sometimes you don't you really don't care it's-kind of well 
you know God's just there he's not Lord he's not first he's 
not-priority in your life and there's going to be a 
there's-going to be a great sifting of the sand and you're 
going to see the good-stuff rise to the top and the bad 
stuff go to the-bottom because it there's a there's a line 
being drawn in the sand there's-being a line drawn in the 
sand and God is saying who is for me and who is truly-for 
me and who is truly just ride in the fence and who who is 
truly against-me are you on the Lord's Side if he calls one 
last call do you-hear his voice are you the one that he's 
calling-that's not listening is your head down in 
that-grass thinking that you're eating and you're-safe do 
you truly believe that if Jesus came back today in the 
Rapture of the-church that you would go with him do you 
believe-it or is it just something that's just when 
it's-convenient is a God is your relationship with 
God-convenient I have to ask you these things there's one 
last-all he's trying to tell you that he loves-you do you 
hear him today don't turn him-away it's time for you to 
fall more in love with Jesus it's time for you to-give your 
heart and be sold out it's time for you to sell out to 
Jesus-today none of the world and all of him all to thee my 
precious Lord All To-Thee I surrender all just like that 
beautiful song I-surrender all have you surrendered all are 
you riding the fence do you have-one foot in the world do 
you have one foot in with Jesus like I said is he had-just 
a convenient relationship just because we want fireproof 
insurance-he's much more than that if you could truly see 
the-compassion on his face that I saw for-Humanity the 
concern that this dispensation of time-is coming to an end 
but he wants not that one man should perish but all come-to 
repentance will you give him a chance-today would you yield 
yourself over to him-today would you tell him I want you to 
be my Lord and personal-savior he's waiting with his arms 
wide open waiting for you to give your heart-over to him 
fully stop running there's so many of-you running there's 
so many of you all that think well I I I'll yield 
over-whenever I get older I'll I'll I'll give my heart 
to-Jesus whenever it's convenient right now I'm enjoying 
sin I'm enjoying-living like the world but the Lord told me 
to tell-you time is over whether that is a year from now 
5-years or whatever when you look at the scale of-Eternity 
it's nothing it's just a vapor life is a-vapor hell is 
forever Heaven is forever which one do you choose do you 
choose-heaven or do you choose hell if you die tonight in 
your sleep where will you-spend eternity you say well I 
used I sa I said the sinner's prayer I've done all-this 
I've done everything I oh yeah you know I did it when I was 
a kid but I-live like the world and I've said it before the 
very thing you say you were-saved from you went back to 
well I was saved I got saved when I-was five 10 years old I 
went and got baptized in the church and did all-this but 
you haven't spoken to him since does he know-you does he 
know you you may say to know somebody what does that really 
mean I-I'm familiar with them I say that to a lot of people 
people say I know brandan-oh yeah I know him I've seen him 
on YouTube they don't know me they they-they they have they 
have an idea about me but you don't know me none of you 
all-do none of y'all do the only people who-really know me 
are my kids and my wife maybe my mom and my dad they raised 
me-but the people who were intimate with me helping me out 
along the-way but none of you know me I'll be real with you 
you've heard a lot about me and-you may have heard a lot 
about Jesus you may have heard a lot about-Bible stories 
but that doesn't mean you know-him there's an intimacy with 
the father that is a day-to-day process just-like it is 
with your family that knows you intimately a lot of you and 
does-whenever he said you prophesied of my name you laid 
hands on the sick and they-recovered in my name you cast 
out devils in my name and he said depart from me I-never 
knew you does he know you does he know you like I said 
before-that shows some a little up and spiritual if you can 
cast out a devil-that takes some faith if you if you if you 
can lay hands on the sick and see-him recover that takes 
some that takes something-too you can you can prophesy too 
and that takes something because you you had-to have heard 
his voice he didn't say a false prophet in my name he said 
you-prophesied my name so that means you heard him but do 
you know him he said-depart from me I never knew you I'm 
asking you today to check your heart I'm-asking you today 
to cry out to Jesus and make him your lord and savior not a 
just-a not a a person that you have that is convenient 
Christianity is not-convenient a lot of times there's a lot 
of persecution that has come my way-recently but I stand 
with him and he visits me and he said Brandon 
the-persecution will increase but the anointing will 
also-increase and as you do what I tell you to do I will 
use you more and more do-not fear man fear me it's not 
always easy to hear those-things but I to it for him 
because I want him to look at me and say Well done-thy good 
and faithful servant enter into my rest that's all I'm 
after every day I-say father Use Me For Your Glory for we 
have this treasure in Earth and vessels-that the Excellence 
see the power will be known of him and not of-me that's all 
I have for you on this video but I want to give you all 
a-chance to ask Jesus Christ to be your lord and savior you 
say this prayer-after me father I'm a sinner I've been away 
from-you it just has to be just make it personal you don't 
have to make it all-religious these and thou just be real 
father I'm a-sinner I ask you to come into my life and I 
want and make you my lord and-personal savior forgive me 
and cleanse me from all unrighteousness forgive me-of my 
sins I want you to write my name in the-Lamb's Book of Life 
I yield myself over to you do with-me have your way in my 
life you're you're my you're my captain of my-ship I need 
you I'm I'm I'm lost without you-thank you Lord that you 
you You' forgiven me thank you Lord that Jesus-died for me 
and rose again on the third day and I you believe it 
believe it with-your heart that he died and rose again on 
the third day say out your mouth that-he's your lord and 
then make a way go find a Bible believing church that 
prays-reads their Bible and teaches you how to live by 
faith and get plugged into that-church it's that easy 
forgive just just and and then stop being a 
knucklehead-stop practicing it yeah we stop we fall down 
and we skin our knees but we do not-do it habitually on 
purpose I'm going to go out and party and have fun 
tonight-and then I'm going to repent on Sunday no if we 
mess up we mess up and then we-don't run from God when we 
sin we run to God our sin is none of the devil's-business 
but he will tempt you and then be beat you over the head 
with it cuz he-is the he is the accuser and the Brethren 
but we have got to get to a-place where we say Lord have 
your way in me I know I I I am I I am not going to-be able 
to do this on my own that's called Grace but there's comes 
a point-in time where the people make a choice that's what 
I'm trying to tell yall you-choose to live in sin a lot of 
you they say well I choose to go out and look at-bad things 
on the internet I choose to to to go to the bad clubs I 
choose to to-to uh fornicate and have adultery and do all 
this you choose to do those things-you're tempted but you 
choose you can say-no submit yourself therefore unto God 
resist the devil and he will flee get-yourself in the word 
read the Bible and pray and I'm and I'm not here to 
con-condemn anybody we're all work in progress but I'm 
trying to tell yall-there's a pro there's a process to it 
that you walk your salvation out with-fear and trembling 
and we seek Him daily we seek Him daily-and he will clean 
you up and make you make you all polished up and it 
takes-it's a process okay that part of it some of you all 
have some bad addictions some-of you are some bad bondage 
you don't give up you just keep going to him when-you fall 
you stand back up when you fall you stand back up does it 
make sense I'm-trying to make it easy for you so for all 
the rest of you I just say I bless-you in the name of Jesus 
thank you for watching this video if this blessed you-and 
and you want to uh tell somebody about it uh like the video 
share it-comment down below uh it helps to get in the 
algorithm I they have been after me-the YouTube and uh

a song in your heart Jesus loves you so much-and we love
