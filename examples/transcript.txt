[Music] welcome to Mayo Clinic sleep medicine-podcasts a 
series for Physicians advanced practice providers nurses 
and-other health practitioners treating Sleep Disorders or 
interested in-learning about state-of-the-art advances in 
sleep medicine and sleep health I'm-your host Dr Michael 
Silber and I'm your co-host Dr MRI Juna we are 
both-Consultants at the center for sleep medicine at the 
Mayo Clinic in Rochester-Minnesota thank you all for 
joining us for today's sleep medicine podcast-today's topic 
will be 45 years of the mslt where are we now Mary 
carscadden-first developed the mslt in 1978 so the 
technique has been used in-the diagnosis of narcolepsy for 
nearly 4 5 years you might have expected that by-now the 
performance parameters and interpretation of the test would 
be-highly standardized although there are several 
controversies that still exist-to discuss the mslt in 20124 
I'm joined today by my guest Dr-Michael silur professor of 
Neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine 
and-Science and a board certified sleep specialist thank 
you Dr silur-Mike could you tell us about how important 
prior sleep deprivation-avoidance is um in interpreting the 
mslt thank you myrie um yes this is very-important it's not 
easy always to achieve but it is absolutely vital for-an 
accurate interpretation of the mslt we know that from a 
number of studies if-we go back as far as 1996 there's a 
very interesting study on the subjects but-all of them were 
young people who said I sleep adequately at least 7 hours 
a-night and then they were instructed to increase their 
sleep time to 10 hours a-night for a couple of weeks and 
the mslt was repeated and the mean sleep latency-over those 
subjects went up um from I believe 6 minutes average to 11 
minutes-and we suspect that even though they said they all 
slept adequately before-they were probably sleep deprived 
and as soon as it was corrected mslt latency-shot up um 
another piece of evidence comes from the community-based 
Wisconsin-sleep cohort which you'll recall was a series of 
mainly middle-aged um patients-subjects from Wisconsin 
taken randomly off the street no preparation whatsoever-and 
one of the um parameters they looked at was sleep onet REM 
periods on an mslt-and they found that the odds ratio for 
developing sleep onset REM was-dramatically increased when 
they were shift workers or when they just had less-sleep 
than the average person in that cohort so again sleep 
deprivation with-or without Cadian Rhythm abnormalities 
certainly affects the MSL so how do we-go about it 
practically well I'm pleased that in the revised-2021 um 
parameters for msot that the ASM brought out they a lot 
clearer that you-really have to aim if at all possible for 
at least 7 hours sleep a night for-two weeks before the 
study including of course the polysomnogram night 
the-previous ones had this really controversial 6our rule 
which was-misinterpreted by everybody to mean you only 
needed 6our sleep which wasn't at-all what was intended but 
now it's been clarified at least seven hours if at 
all-possible and we know that some patients with narpy just 
can't always achieve-that so what do I do practically I 
spend a lot of time on this I talk to the-patient and I say 
for at least a week preferably two weeks before the study 
I-want you to try achieve eight hours in bed every night so 
I extend it even-further and I don't say at our sleep 
because you can't tell anybody how long-they sleep that 
depends on their mind and their brain but I say try get 
eight-hours in bed every night and I really emphasize the 
night before they come-back because a lot of our patients 
at Mayo travel from a bit of a distance so-they may get up 
early the previous day to drive maybe 6 7 eight hours to 
get-here or to fly I say if you're flying um take a day 
flight not an early morning-flight not an evening flight be 
sure you've got adequate sleep especially-that critical 
last night before they come back to see me before we go 
ahead-with a study um during that time I really want them 
to wear an actograph if-they Ensure will cover it which 
most but not all will um the Sleep log is Not-Enough by 
itself at least in an ideal situation now of course there 
are some-patients whose insurance won't cover an actor 
graph and the question is whether-you can use some other 
wearable commercially available wearable it's not-the best 
because most of them you can't see the ice the actual days 
how long-they slept it's a sort of summit of value but it's 
certainly a can best if-you can't have an actograph and if 
they do have such a wearable then they come-and see me and 
I check everything's okay and then we do the polysomnogram 
and I-really emphasize it's important for everybody's sleep 
lab to have a separate-protocol for pre mslt polysomnogram 
so ours has do not turn the patient do not-disturb the 
patient and unless there's some specific reason for it and 
let them-sleep in so they try achieve a minimum of seven 
hour sleep that night now-sometimes they just can't get 
there but we let them sleep in almost routinely-till 700 
a.m. and some of our patients sleep into until 8:00 a.m. 
before we get-them up before the mslt-so we're living in a 
real world we try our best I go through all this I write-it 
down and then the patient comes back and says oh well there 
was a party that-night five days or 4 days before it was a 
birthday party to a relative and I was-up till 1: in the 
morning and you went to s live with those things you 
can't-abort the whole thing as a result of course if the 
person comes back and-they've got three hours sleep at 
night the whole time we do have aborted but we-try our best 
to eliminate sleep deprivation that's all very helpful 
Mike-thank you for reviewing that and really I think 
helpful to hear how you address-some of those practical 
issues in terms of actigraphy not paying you know 
being-paid for by insurance or dealing with some of the 
mishaps during the uh-recording session uh another 
controversy is whether all psychotropic medications-should 
be discontinued prior to the mslt could you tell us a bit 
about what the-data really show us in this regard and how 
important this is and perhaps how-you go about managing 
this well this is another really vital issue um let me-tell 
you about a study we um did a little while ago under the 
direction of-my colleague baru Cola who's both a 
psychiatrist and a um addiction spe-addiction specialist as 
well as a sleep specialist what we looked 
at-retrospectively was a large number of our msot patients 
now most of us at Mayo-stop anti-depressants two weeks at 
least before the study but we did have a-fairly large group 
of patients who for whatever reason the physician 
ordering-the study at Mayo decided it wasn't in the 
patient's interest and they went-ahead taking REM 
suppressant anti-depressants at the time of the-study and 
what we showed was when we looked for Sleep onid periods so 
we-found those who had not discontinued the REM suppressant 
um-anti-depressants um found that only 2% of the cohort had 
two or more so Rems um-compared to 19% of the patients 
who'd tapered their anti-depressants at least-2 weeks 
before and this wasn't just a withdrawal rebound because 
they done it-at least um two weeks before when we looked at 
who met nopy criteria um it-only 2% of those who had not 
discontinued the anti-depressant met-narpy criteria 
compared to 133% of the cohort who had been weaned first so 
yes-if you don't take them off the anti-depressants it's 
extremely hard to-diagnose narcolepsy based on the sorm 
criteria um of course they may still-have a short sleep 
latency because generally we think the 
anti-depressants-don't have too much effect on sleep 
latency those say sometimes are dating-but we try our best 
to get them off now obviously if a patient's just 
been-discharged from a psychiatric hospital following um a 
suicide attempt there is-no ways we that we're going to 
take them off an anti-depressant if they've got-active 
epilepsy we're not going to take them off sedating seizure 
medications-but generally I personally don't do mslts then 
I try work things out in a-different way and use other 
modalities that is controversial but yes we try-take them 
off and I would I am so pleased to see that the new 
criteria-state that on the msot report The Physician has to 
put what drugs they-were on at the time of the study 
because I so often see reports of msls done-elsewhere and I 
have no idea what drugs they were on and the patient 
doesn't-remember and I hope that people are starting to do 
that because it is really-so so helpful so I take them off 
if I possible to weeks before for-anti-depressants I 
discuss carefully with them their symptoms if there's 
any-doubt I involve their psychiatrist many of the patients 
say no I've been on them-for years I'm sure I can come off 
safely I've never had suicidal thinking so I-usually wean 
them to reduce the dose for a couple of weeks first and 
then-discontinue and tell them contact us at once if your 
depression gets worse or-especially if any suicidal 
thinking comes up and started again abought the-whole thing 
and we talk carefully about it and I I will tell you I can 
get-almost everybody off the sedating medications prior to 
the study it's not-fun for the patient but it's doable and 
if these are stimulants amphetamines or-myopenid or modaal 
we have to talk about probably not driving for the two 
weeks-Pro possibly not working and I give medical 
certificates so they can get-FMLA or whatever else is 
needed to cover them over that time but I'm 
generally-successful that's very helpful Mike are there any 
medications um that you would-hold for longer than two 
weeks or perhaps shorter than two weeks are there-any 
exceptions to the rule so to speak yes that's an excellent 
question the-classic one is fluoxitine which has a really 
long half life and I try get them-off for 6 weeks cannabis 
hangs around for a long time as well at least on-blood 
tests how much it's hang around the brain I don't know so 
we try get-them off cannabis for a longer period than two 
weeks if we can and um shorter-ones caffeine we try get 
them down on caffeine and I'm usually pretty lenient-on 
that if possible four five days off before the study the 
idea is to get them-off five Half Lives before the study so 
sometimes we're more lenient and again-it's a real world 
and somebody they come back and say oh well I had a 
headache-and I had to take something that had an opioid in 
it or something 3 days before-and we know it's probably out 
of the system by then and we say fine go ahead-very helpful 
and very much the real world uh so diagnostic criteria 
for-narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia in the-icd3 uh 
require a mean initial sleep latency of 8 minutes or less 
can you-tell us a bit about where this number comes from 
and is it really a valid cut-off well that is so 
interesting you know when the ASM came up with their 
first-careful protocols for the mslt in 20 5 um Donna arant 
a psychologist who was-very involved in all this which 
chaired the committee and did an extensive-review of all 
studies um done on the mslt before and she found um a 
nine-papers that looked carefully at the mslt in patients 
with absolutely apparently-proven nipsy and there were 255 
subjects in-that joint analysis and she found the mean 
latency on the mslt was 3.1 minutes-with a standard 
deviation of 2.9 so if you add two standard-deviations to 
3.1 you get 8.9 not eight um then came along ICD 2 and the 
people-putting together the hypersomnia section and I must 
admit I was one of the-committee members there um came up 
with this 8 Minute cut off because we had to-have some sort 
of cut off and to be quite honest I can't remember 
the-reasoning why we went for 8 minutes and not 8.9 minutes 
but the text I looked at-it up looked up in preparation for 
this for icd2 did say be care for perhaps 15%-of 
narcoleptics will have longer latencies um icd3 however 
dropped that-statement even though it kept the 8 Minute cut 
off so the vast majority of-noptic patients will have 
latencies mean latencies of 8 minutes or less but it it-is 
not a scientific cut off nothing happens to in the brain at 
8 minutes and-I think we've got to use the mslt as an 
extension of clinical method and if the-patient is 
classically sleepy and you feel this is what it is and the 
latency-is 9 minutes or even 9.5 it's still compatible and 
one doesn't cut it off-now some insurances may not pay for 
medication if they want that exact-Criterion makes things 
difficult but as physician-I think we need to be lenient 
and realize that that is not meant as an-absolute cut off 
now as far as idopathic hypersomnia goes this was 
simply-extrapolated to IH without a lot of evidence at all 
and of course we know-some patients with IH have even 
normal latencies and that's why we have that-second 
Criterion of more than 660 minutes sleep done over the per 
per day-over the course of a week with unrestricted sleep 
because there are-some people who have msot latencies with 
IH even greater than 10 minutes so it's-helpful as a cut 
off the eight but it's not an absolute cut off at-all thank 
you for sharing that also very helpful so as far as the 
icd3 TR that-now has a new Criterion for the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy type one uh-stating that if there's a sleep 
onset REM period on the preceding nights-polysomnogram an 
mslt is no longer required to make this 
particular-diagnosis is can you tell us a bit about how 
valid this Criterion really is well-there's both an adult 
and a pediatric study I'll concentrate in the adult-study 
the results are much the same the adult study was a large 
study in-multiple centers um it was published in 2013 and 
Al is the first author and for-nt1 patients they had 516 
compared to 516 Community controls an enormous study-they 
found that the specificity for that less than 15 minutes 
Ram latency on the-preceding polysomnogram was 98% which is 
extremely high the-sensitivity was only 44% so more than 
half patients who eventually ended up-with a diagnosis of 
narcolepsy type 1 didn't have that um REM latency but-98% 
did and but but the specificity was 98% very few people who 
didn't end up-with that um diagnosis of narpy actually had 
so Rems and in fact in the control-only 0.8% of the 516 
control subjects had-that um short latency for REM on the 
PSG so it looks it's both sensitive and-specific but we 
have to be careful to be sure that the study was done under 
good-conditions um not suddenly stopping REM suppressant 
drugs the the day before and-being sure they've got extend 
um sufficient sleep um at the at the time-just as we 
discussed earlier in this podcast again I'd emphasize that 
in the-Wisconsin health study which was just a random study 
of the population there was-only 4% so RMS on the PSG very 
low in the population that was even a random-population and 
those who did have it correlated with insufficient sleep 
and-shift work the same things coming through and through 
so yes I think this-is a valid Criterion if you suspect 
nopy type one that clinically would mean nopy-with 
cataplexy and your PSG done appropriately shows a SRM you 
don't have-to go ahead with the mslt to reach the diagnosis 
and I think that's appropriate-but not for nopy type 2 if 
there's no cataplexy this data Isn't So robust and-you 
should always go ahead with the mslt even if there's a s 
but you can count-that so as one of the two SS for the 
purpose of reaching the diagnosis if-there's only one SRM 
on the subsequent MSL that's very helpful Mike so I 
think-really the take-home point there is yes you can use 
this uh new Criterion but-when your clinical suspicion for 
narcolepsy type one is there but if you-randomly happen to 
stumble upon a sleep onset REM period on the 
preceding-night's polysomnogram when studying the patient 
for something else like sleep-apnea then you really need to 
interpret that with caution with great caution yes-I think 
that summarizes it very well my three do you have any final 
messages-that you'd like to leave with our listeners today 
Mike well yes I'd say-after 45 years the mslt is still a 
very helpful and valid tool for the diagnosis-of disorders 
of hypersomnolence but number one it must be done 
correctly-precisely and under very controlled circumstances 
at least as much as the-real world allows and second it 
must be part of clinical method this is not like-an 
isolated test it's got to be integrated with the clinicians 
pre-test-probabilities and likelihood and clinical um 
Acumen and experience and-you have to interpret it in that 
way there are other ways of looking at narpy-and in a 
subsequent podcast we'll talk about orex and a in the 
spinal fluid but-we don't have a lot of other biomarkers 
and until we develop them I think the-mslt will continue to 
be done and that's the correct approach um but as part 
of-clinical method and done under very careful conditions 
so I hope that's been-helpful thanks very much for sharing 
your expertise with us today Mike it's a-pleasure we hope 
you enjoyed this podcast if so please tune in again-through 
wherever you receive your podcasts as we discuss further 
topics in-sleep medicine and sleep Health thank you-[Music]
