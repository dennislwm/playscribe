e [Music]-welcome back everyone we're here for another Q&A 
we're going to talk about-keto intermittent fasting 
nutrition you name it uh bring your questions but-anything 
that I say that violates your agreement between you and 
your doctor-just check with them first because that's I 
have to make that disclaimer-all right Steve we're going to 
try to rapidly go through as many questions as-humanly 
possible today you ain't kid we're going to knock out the 
hour with-tons so let's start off with social media and 
let's go to Esmeralda from-YouTube what can I do to help 
treat a swollen lower back on my right-side I mean the 
thing that comes to mind first is um a natural 
anti-inflammatory-and that would be vitamin D probably no 
less than 20,000 I use um and what's-interesting about one 
of the first symptoms of vitamin D when you're-deficient is 
is low back pain so that could help you also even if it's a 
dis-problem there's a lot of vitamin D receptors in the 
disc itself for a-reason to help support collagen in that 
disc so I think-uh that would probably be the greatest 
thing you should do um of course if it's-higher up in the 
lower back it could mean potential Stone kidney you 
know-problem but again I I need more data to figure that 
out okay Esmeralda good luck-with that lamped Ward from 
YouTube what could be-the reason behind a person not losing 
weight despite cutting back on a lot of-calories and only 
eating once or twice a day I know you would think that if 
you-just cut calories you lose weight probably what's 
happening is your-metabolism is very efficient which is a 
nice way of saying-slow um so I don't know what you're 
eating when-you're eating it um so rather than focus on 
calories I would focus on keeping-your carbs low as as low 
as possible and then the second thing if you're just-doing 
one meal a day um and you're not losing weight are you 
losing-size um if you're losing size what could be 
happening is you could be gaining-muscle mass and that can 
be a little bit heavier per volume than fat so you're-going 
to uh you might be losing fat but not losing 
weight-initially but I think a much better indicator to 
know if it's working or not-is your Cravings go away and 
can you go from one meal to the next um without-being 
hungry or too hungry because if you're truly in fat burning 
you have you-just don't have an appetite anymore and if 
that's happening then you just need-to ride the wave give 
it more time to let it work because it's all about-getting 
healthy to lose weight not losing weight to get healthy 
very-encouraging okay our great friend seow tin from Rumble 
is hair analysis a good-indicator for mineral deficiency 
and heavy metals in the body that's-interesting I think 
it's a a rough idea with certain minerals and 
definitely-heavy metals but um here's the problem with uh 
like magnesium and potassium-99.9% or actually probably 99% 
of all that mineral is not going to be-necessarily where 
you could find it easily it's going to be deeper in 
the-cell this is why I like blood analysis even hair 
analysis it doesn't really-tell you what's really going on 
uh intracellularly so uh for that you need-to do a biopsy 
or there's other tests you can do but it's it's not easy 
to-find out if you're deficient in that so um I I don't 
really um use that as a-reliable test the hair analysis 
there's some pluses and minuses it's a little-bit hazy but 
you know it wouldn't hurt just to look at it see see what 
it says-especially for heavy metals all right dig into that 
yavon-from Facebook my dermatologist says I have overload 
of yeast on my scalp yuck-what can I do to improve this 
condition a lot of people address this-topically with some 
cream zinc cream um castro oil things like that I-really 
think there's a communication from the microbi-imbalance on 
the surface of your skin and your gut there's definitely 
a-connection because I know people that have problem with 
the gut and they maybe-take an antibiotic and then they end 
up with a skin problem wait a second how-did that happen 
because there's this whole communication Network and um 
it's-all it all works together so I would focus on the 
inside of your body just as-much as the outside with a good 
probiotic um one thing that feeds yeast-and candida is 
sugar and carbs start es things like that so you got to get 
off-that probably up your garlic um and then just give it 
time and I think um that-that can be greatly improved all 
right Kashi from YouTube what is the best way-to treat a 
fatty Le liver excuse me an enlarg gall-bladder I think the 
the fastest way is getting on the healthy version of 
the-ketogenic diet you can actually remove fat when you do 
that um couple other-things that can speed things up 
choline choline is a good nutrient to help get-fat off your 
liver and so um those are the two things I would I would do 
as far-as the gallbladder goes um what irritates the 
gallbladder is nuts grains-seeds things like that um you 
may benefit from TKA which will thin the-bile take this the 
pressure off the gallbladder um but you know I think 
I-would stick with those those recommendations okay very 
good Anita-from Facebook how can I naturally bring down my 
blood-pressure probably the most common cause of high blood 
pressure that when you-look into alternative type things or 
viewpoints is a deficiency in vitamin-D and one of the side 
effects for by taking too much D is that you end up-with 
low blood pressure so H 90% of all type of hypertension is 
called essential-which means they don't know what causes it 
um-but it's going to be either a problem with the vitamin 
D-deficiency maybe a potassium deficiency but also the 
inside layer of your artery-can be inflamed so I know of 
someone very young 22y old athlete top athlete-has uh 
starting to get some high blood pressure and um the first 
thing I'm-going to ask is what are you eating and sure 
enough pancakes syrup more carbs-all that's very 
inflammatory in the inside of the artery which then 
can-trigger this reaction the blood pressure starts going 
up so just by making that-tiny little change in the diet 
you can usually handle blood pressure so if-someone has 
high blood pressure before you start trying different 
vitamins and-stuff get rid of the sugars and the the 
starches and that that might just handle-it right there 
very good sadon from YouTube can smoking contribute to 
the-formation of psoriasis I don't know I I I don't know-if 
that's a primary thing um so I'm not sure but it's um 
probably contributes to-a lot of other problems yeah no 
kidding okay dehy from YouTube what are the best-sources 
for Boron they have uh a product out there-borax um that is 
a mineral I think it's from a part of Utah if I'm not 
mistaken-but borax is a interesting thing there's been some 
past research for arthritis-beneficials arthritis so Boron 
is a um is a mineral that supports Bone and-Joint uh it's 
also natural anti-inflammatory you don't need much of-it 
it's a trace mineral and uh some people get it from doing 
borax borax-also is a powerful anti-inflammatory I'm 
sorry-antimicrobial so the reason I don't talk about it 
too-much is because um you'll be quickly banned from 
YouTube of recommending-these bizarre remedies that you 
know people don't want you to talk about all-right so Karen 
from uh great questions today Karen from Facebook in 
your-opinion what milk is the best source of overall 
nutrition cow coconut almond or-hemp Etc MH goat sheep then 
cow the type of-protein I would recommend is uh A2 protein 
it's a type of-um but I don't like these other milks I mean 
I don't even consider them milk how-can you actually get 
milk out of an almond or a-soybean or a coconut well a 
coconut okay that's a little bit better but these-other 
things uh I I would stay away from them all-right you heard 
it Monica from uh Facebook what are the best nut 
nutrients-to improve Vision um I think the best thing 
for-vision Believe It or Not would be um you have vitamin A 
get that from codiv oil-because if you're deficient in 
vitamin A not only do you get night blindness you-can 
actually become blind um there's a couple other nutrients 
involved uh one-is vitamin D deficiency that can create um 
problems with the-retina um as far as um other mechanisms 
high-blood glucose is probably the the single thing that 
destroys that retina um that-you need to change the diet 
all right zezy from YouTube please tell-me what to do to 
address low phosphorus levels how do you know you have 
low-phosphorus you can get it tested see if you're low with 
phosphorus it could be a-problem with your parathyroid um 
but you can get good a-good source of phosphorus from raw 
milk cheese and uh you have to you you know-find some 
cheese um that has um that's aged for two months in the-US 
so it's considered and it says Raw on it cuz that's kind of 
the loophole that-you can use or if you're in Europe that's 
even better yet you could uh get-some raw milk cheese but 
that's low to with a good source of phosphorus just-curious 
what's the ramifications of low phosphorus is that 
fatigue-fatigue yeah okay well listen why don't we hit the 
audience with the first-question of the day and there it is 
okay which body tissue has the most-concentrated omega3 
climb on it audience and let's see let's-go back to social 
media Sandy from YouTube in your opinion uh uh sorry-excuse 
me what's your opinion on NAD supplements how much per day 
should we-take NAD supplements help support um part of the 
mitochondria because it-helps to carry electrons and helps 
you make energy it helps the mitochondrial-work as you age 
NAD goes down and there's a whole very interesting 
video-I'm going to create probably in a month from now on 
that topic because um it's-regarding anti-aging but I think 
one quick way to increase your NAD levels is-just to take 
nin because the precursor the building block that makes ad 
n ad is-nin now you can um purchase a an expensive um 
molecule like NAD for-example plus and uh um different 
derivatives of that which-are a lot more expensive but you 
don't really need to you just take nin the-flesh kind and 
take a little bit more and you'll get the same benefit 
wow-that's uh helpful say off not say Dow from YouTube my 
76-year-old mom has-hyperthyroidism what supplements should 
she be taking she's already eliminated-Dairy gluten and 
processed sugar from her diet take large amounts of 
vitamin-B1 and also probably take vitamin D because-it's 
usually an autoimmune disease Graves and that will lower 
the-inflammation you need like probably 30 40 50,000 iuse 
make sure that you take-it with magnesium uh but B1 is 
important and if-you're taking any bile salts avoid them 
because that's going to speed up the-thyroid that's good 
for hypothyroidism not hyper because it's-going to make 
your thyroid more hyper okay uh Marie who is in Toronto 
on-YouTube what's the best way to recover from a taxia 
caused by a brain tumor-surgery you want to touch that one 
methylene blue is a good remedy for-that dilute it you want 
to buy the um food grade methylene blue um a good-source of 
vitamin E called tokat trinal would also be beneficial um 
those are-two things that I I would probably take if I had 
that problem all right Marie-hope that helps Sharon from 
YouTube I've been experienced quite a few 
heart-palpitations lately I just came off from wearing a 
heart monitor for 30 days and-now waiting on the results 
any idea what's causing these-palpitations it's usually a 
deficiency of a mineral that is super important-behind 
arrhythmias very hard to test and it's-not as easy to get 
in the diet um and it can have profound effects over 
the-rhythm of the heart and other aspects of the heart not 
just magnesium um but-here's the thing you can't just take 
a little magnesium and think you're GNA-get rid of that 
within a a few days sometimes it takes weeks to see 
the-change so if I had arhythmia or strong palpitations I 
would be taking probably-600 to 800 um milligrams of 
magnesium glycinate it'll also help you-sleep now you may 
need some potassium with that you also um might like for 
me-I had palpitations when I slept and that was coming from 
the this-EMF thing that was in the back of my not my cell 
phone but in the back of the-wall there was crosswires and 
I was being bathed in a magnetic field which-is not good 
for the heart um but palpitations are one of the um a 
good-indication that you need more magnesium um also check 
for other things too like-you know do you um do you put 
your cell phone in your pocket right here right-right over 
your heart that would be a bad-thing all right don't do 
that for goodness sakes a good day to all of our-viewers 
joining us uh in the UK Canada Mexico Albania Jordan Japan 
Greece Italy-Nigeria Bangladesh Germany Chile Panama South 
Africa Egypt Sweden France-Indonesia Trinidad and Tobago 
Pakistan Israel Switzerland Armen Poland Finland-Ethiopia 
the Netherlands uh India Oman Saudi Arabia Australia the 
Virgin-Islands Qatar brunai Scotland Gambia Barbados 
Thailand Cyprus uh let's see it-jumped a little bit there 
uh uh Gambia Barbados Cyprus we said that Morocco-Zanzibar 
Guyana uh the Czech Republic Kazakhstan New Zealand don't 
want to-forget those and we don't want to forget all across 
these United States so thanks-everybody so much for tuning 
in in and making the show a great success and-speaking of 
success the audience is always successful in answering 
uh-questions and this one asks which body tissue has the 
most concentrated omega3-or DHA 80% of our respondents say 
it's the-brain 5% say it's the skin 5% say it's the liver 
5% say it's the heart and 5%-say it's in the eyes boy 
they're all over the place any Winter's doc-it's the eyes 
um 60% of all fatty-acids um are concentrated in the retina 
now which is an extension of your brain-so those of you 
that said brain are partially correct but number two 
is-brain that's that's like 25% of all the fatty acids are 
DHA omega-3 fatty acids-so um the brain and the eyes are 
like the uh get the L share of this uh DHA so-people are 
taking fish oil but unfortunately-when you go to the 
cheapest you're getting something processed from China-that 
is probably rancid and could have heavy metals when it 
comes down-to something that's going to replace or feed our 
cell membranes I-would want a higher quality version of 
fish oil I like Civ oil um so just-invest a little bit more 
in that one because that one's are important 
versus-something like niin which even though it's synthetic 
it doesn't seem to be a-problem it seems to work there's 
doesn't seem to be toxic effects but when you-get into oils 
that go into the membranes go higher end with that because 
you-don't want these cheap things going into your cell 
membranes also the other thing-is they um they compete with 
the omega-6 fatty acids like the the seed oils so if-you're 
consuming the seed oils then the Omega the DHA is not 
going-to go in so um that's a really big problem all right 
very good why don't we-go to our first contestant if you 
will today and his name is Jeff and he's-coming to us from 
Providence Rhode Island Jeff go ahead with your 
quick-question for Dr Berg hey Dr Berg um I have a you 
know-times severe bloating and based on your videos you 
know I think I might have-sibo but uh I'm a near vegan and 
is there another option other than the-carnivore diet to 
help with I will say it's it's difficult because-you eat a 
lot of plants and you eat um probably everything vegan that 
tends to-ferment they're heavy in the carbs so that's a 
tough one um I don't know if-maybe you could do maybe 
instead of carnivore do um just vegetarian and have-maybe 
eggs as your protein and then um as far as-the what's that 
I don't eat eggs I'm sorry I know you-don't um so the 
problem is like how do we get rid of the fermentation in 
your-small intestine because of bloating um there's a even 
like in India it's the-highest population of vegan and 
vegetarian people so you have a lot of-fermentation 
bloating in the small intestine um so what are you going 
to-eat that's not going to ferment that I mean if you-took 
um probotics that could make it worse because what's 
happening is have-the bacteria in the wrong place it's in 
the small intestine you don't you want-it in the large 
intestine so when it's in a small intestine as soon as 
that-food goes in there it starts fermenting and the 
problem with these uh-these microbes is they start stealing 
your um your nutrients so you might end-up with more 
nutritional deficiencies so I guess the only thing I would 
say as a-tip would be garlic uh thyme Sage some herbs 
that-maybe could as a natural antibiotic and do 
intermittent fasting so you give it a-chance for all that 
stuff to clear out to some degree uh and maybe some 
apple-cider vinegar um to acidify the stomach a little bit 
more but probably what-happened is you lost your stomach 
acid acidity and so then some certain-microbes got through 
and they started to form in the small small gut but it's 
a-big problem yeah yeah I tried uh I tried to-live on 
Bagels for a while that didn't work that didn't work I'm 
surprised um-yeah I I have that t-shirt too still Al I used 
to do the brand muffins for-breakfast and uh I always 
wonder why I had so much bloating in the morning-so yeah 
well uh you're welcome all right thanks for a great call uh 
Jeff we-appreciate it and hope that helps okay let's go to 
quiz question uh number two-for the day and and uh doc 
there it is okay true or false trans fats were-considered 
generally recognized as safe which is gross for over a 
hundred-years All Right audience we know you'll grasp on of 
that back to social media-lur from Facebook cod oil or 
Krill supplements which is better for your n-nutritional 
okay so Krill has a bit more um Omega-3s than even fish oil 
but one-advantage of cod Li oil is that it has also vitamin 
d and vitamin A so I I-think they're both good uh I tend to 
do the cod oil um just because it has these-additional 
things and if you really look at let's just take vitamin A 
which is-very very important I don't eat liver um I wish I 
liked it but I can't eat it so-you do get vitamin a from a 
lot of foods but not in large amounts but you do get-the 
precursor to vitamin A which is beta carotene which doesn't 
convert over that-much in plants and things like that so 
vitamin A is not as easy as you think to-try to get from 
General Foods unless you're doing something like Civ oil 
or-maybe um certain grass-fed like butter uh liver organ 
Meats things like that um-but don't rely on your vitamin A 
from vegetables because that's the precursor-it's called 
beta carotene and you probably get like a few percent 
that-converts the act the active form of retinol so retinol 
is really important-for the immune system the inner 
membranes and your sinuses all through-your digestive 
system as well as for your immune system and your eyes 
all-right very good good grief audience you guys are fast 
already answered number-two true false trans fats were 
considered generally recognized to save-grass for over a 
hundred years and 90% of you uh say that it's true and 10% 
say-it's a big fat lie who's who's right there so when 
trans fats start started-coming out um a 100 years ago 
there's this they're generally-recognized as safe this is 
gr this gross uh thing is a loophole by industry where-you 
can do your own studies and say it's safe yourself it 
doesn't go through any-independent St studies so you'd be 
shocked to find out how many chemicals-are generally 
recognized as safe so anytime you hear that take it with 
a-grain of salt it's just BS um but here we take trans fats 
have been known to-cause cancer heart disease and so many 
other problems and it's been safe for-over a hundred years 
how could that happen so you can imagine how many 
other-things are generally recognized as safe like multiex 
is safe-right so I think uh we're great examples of human 
guinea pigs Steve interesting-ji from Facebook what are the 
best foods to treat excuse me to eat to address-hair loss 
I'm all ears zinc insufficient-protein from red meat those 
are two recommendations I think could help you-and then the 
third would be B vitamins a lot of B vitamins maybe 
nutritional-yeast would help as well um that would that's 
where I would-start all right uh Arvin from Facebook what's 
your recommendation to treat dry-eyes that's a vitamin A 
deficiency so you guess what you need you need codiv-oil um 
liver and that should that should take-care of it also 
realize if you had your gallbladder removed um then you 
don't-have the bile to help extract vitamin A from the 
foods so I noticed that when-people have their gallbladder 
out or have a gall stone or have gallbladder-problems 
they're deficient in bile and they they can end up with dry 
eyes as-one of the symptoms I had dry eyes really really 
bad to the point where um-it would rip my cornea and of 
course that was probably coming-from slightly poor diet 
that I had for most of my life um which actually 
just-created a deficiency well you know I uh when I-take a 
nap and I have context I'll use the actual lens solution is 
squirted-straight in my eye I don't know if that's good but 
it loosens them it-loosens them up and uh I don't know 
probably not that doctor recommended-Nancy from Facebook is 
drilling down on this question she said that you-mentioned 
that seed oils are bad for us but what are your thoughts 
about black-seed oil supplements any better that's 
completely different-they're not putting through an 
industrial process to extract the-nutrients and heat it and 
put solvents in it you're getting like straight black-seed 
which is super super healthy I mean they found these black 
seed black seeds-in the um two and Commons [Music]-um uh 
mumification what do you call that a tomb-tomb um they 
found that there it's been it's it's been used uh for 
thousands of-years um um anything that did the test of time 
like that there's something to-it of course you're going to 
get people that'll say oh unless there's double-Blended 
studies done by the pharmaceutical companies I'm not 
going-to recommend I'm not going to take it that's fine um 
who's going to pay for-that study it's not going to happen 
yeah no kidding okay Stratovarius 11 from-Rumble please 
explain the basics of health healthy keto everything I 
read-seems aimed at people who need to lose weight I am 
considered underweight-should I take it up and if so how 
can it help me gain weight and stay healthy-good question 
Strat aarius weight weight loss is just one of-the factors 
but take a look at the other thing when you have-um a 
problem that most people have it's called insulin 
resistance um you you-might get fat fatty liver get tired 
craving for-sweets insomnia all these other symptoms right 
but-there's some other things too that can affect um affect 
you um the ability to-absorb nutrients the um alteration of 
your-testosterone um the ability to for the cell for the 
mitochondria to generate-energy so there's so many benefits 
now if you want to gain weight-um you know do you do you 
have to take carbs is that the way to do it what if-you 
just to have keep your carbs below 50 make sure they're 
really like the-carbs are may I don't know berries 
something like that and then what you-can do is going carbs 
and probably not do the nuts so now your digestion 
is-better eat real food healthy food get super healthy and 
then just consume more-a little more calories maybe a 
little more fat and um with your workouts with-weight 
training you should gain some more muscle but it's you 
don't always-have to gain muscle with carbs all right very 
good we're going to toss out quiz-question number three and 
right after that we're going to go to ROM uh Ramy-from 
England so Ramy standby we'll be with you in a minute there 
you go doc-okay how could artificial sweeteners cause more 
weight gain than actual-sugar All Right audience jump on it 
as we know you will and Ramy you're on with-Dr Berg for a 
quick question hi thank you Dr Berg thanks for-speaking to 
me um I had a full panel of Bloods done recently just you a 
few few-weeks ago um it says I have elevated B12 now 
obviously internet land is not-specific on what that 
actually means because there's all sorts of advice on-how 
to increase uh but everything-seems mostly everything seems 
all right including liver and kidney functions so-what 
could that be do you um take B12 as a supplement no no but 
um no I we eat-fairly U healthy because I'm I'm you know 
qualifying imminently as a-naturopathic health coach I do 
follow a lot of your advice we eat only grass-fed-organic 
you know stuff I I do like rice so that's the only reason 
that I don't-really very not very success ESS with keto uh 
but I do intermittent fast um I-try and do 24-hour fast 
once a week uh but the B12 is just uh puzzling-me there's a 
there's only a few um-genetic uh they're called 
polymorphisms uh that relate to B12 and you may 
have-something with that which it's very rare um so I think 
I think that when you get-something like this I would 
retest it because I don't trust um I've seen odd-things 
like this pop out and then all of a sudden you change your 
whole thing and-like oh it was a mistake or was an artifact 
it's it's very weird to have-high levels of B12 if your 
diet is that good um I mean one recommendation I know-you 
do Rice um which is a starch um maybe you can and this is a 
side note-maybe you switch that out with purple potatoes 
just to see if you can do that-this is a little it's just 
more nutrition than white rice but I don't-think that's 
going to affect your B12 but I think I would retest it with 
from-a different lab because I don't know if I trust that 
the odds of you having some-polymorphism with B12 that's 
increasing it I don't know that's that's very rare-as well 
but it's a possibility yeah I feel well in general-because 
you know I feel well but um I don't know how good a measure 
is just to-say you feel well I have plenty of energy even 
though I'm per menopausal I-don't have any brain struggling 
with I have really good energy so-I definitely I think 
that's that's going to be my next step I want to retest 
and-see what somebody this is our beautiful right it's like 
you're looking-into the blood and it doesn't really tell 
you why it just kind of like oh-this is something that just 
kind of a little too high I mean a better test-would be 
that metabolomics test um I talked about that in other 
videos-because then you can actually see B12 in the actual 
enzyme Pathways and see if-it's being utilized correctly 
there's some fascinating information I'm doing-this test um 
like almost every two weeks on myself and the things that 
I'm-discovering is just I would never in a million years 
figure this out with a-blood test like one thing for 
example is that um I tend to really push-myself with 
exercise running up mountains and things like that and so 
my-um antioxidant levels are just off the charts so I'm 
actually generating so-much glutathione to handle the 
oxidative stress which is a normal thing but it's-very um 
it tells me I probably should give more time to recover 
because-mentally I'm still 18 and but physically I'm almost 
60 so anyway um you know it's-I think that metabolomic test 
to get it's good to do at some point in your-life just to 
see really what's going on behind the-scene I literally 
said that to my husband because I saw your episode with-the 
Greek doctor we're not very far from here is that because I 
have-hypothyroidism ah that would be FAS I I yeah yes 
okay-interesting okay yeah that would be something you 
could check out as well-thanks on thanks so much for a 
great call and uh we move on let's say let's-go back to 
social media um uh quiz question number three while Ramy 
was-telling us about things was answered by the audience 
and it asked how can-artificial sweeteners cause more 
weight gain than actual sugar 65% of-respondents say it's 
because artificial sweeteners compromise the function 
of-the gut biome boy that's a lofty answer 20% say it's 
because they cause faster-or more powerful insulin spikes 
and 15% say they can make you hungrier so you-eat more 
who's right I think every I think some people have did a 
quick-search on chat gbt but that's absolutely all three of 
those answers are correct-they definitely increase appetite 
they definitely increase um-insulin indirectly and they 
mess up your microbiome but other than that they're-totally 
fine they're perfectly healthy they're considered generally 
recognized-as safe so by their own standard so I think 
you're good to go on that all-right very good Deborah from 
YouTube I've been diagnosed with-osteopenia uh what are 
your recommendations on addressing this-disease so that's 
kind of a precursor to osteoporosis-um I think I would step 
back and really um reevaluate your whole diet because-it's 
not just one nutrient deficiency for example vitamin K2 has 
a function of-making your bones really solid and keeping 
the calcium in the bone so here-you are taking vitamin K2 
but vitamin K2 is dependent on magnesium to work so oh-now 
we have to take magnesium so I think I would step back and 
go like are you-postmenopausal have you just been through a 
lot of stress um like what's-really behind this do you um 
what's going on with your hormones like is a-high cortisol 
that can destroy these bones but what I wouldn't do is 
start-taking massive doses to just calcium in the form of 
calcium carbonate I'd-probably instead consume more bone 
building calcium complexes from like raw-cheese things like 
that or goats cheese doing that doing the trace 
minerals-making sure that you're um having enough collagen 
like home broth would be really-really really smart um that 
that's what I would start with uh and then consuming-really 
really healthy keto um with lots of vitamin C because 
vitamin C helps the-collagen in the bone um some people 
consider osteoporosis to be scurvy of-the bones which is a 
vitamin C deficiency huh okay so let's try this-same 
routine we're going to go to a question here it is then 
we're going to-go to Ariel and uh Los Angeles so there you 
go doc out of all the nutrients-which one mostly influences 
your energy level all right and as promis here is-Ariel 
Ariel go ahead with your quick question for Dr-bird hi Dr 
berd thanks for having me on the show so I have a pretty 
severe-bloating and after watching each one of your videos 
on sibo for about 20 times-each uh pretty much ruled out 
everything besides uh sibo and I've been on the-carnivore 
diet uh as well as taking pretty much every antimicrobial 
possible-like oregano clove thyme uh taking also eight 
pills of Bane hydrochloride and-apple cider vinegar and um 
while all this has-improved uh like it's still there so 
it's probably improved by 30 40% but-it's still there and 
I'm just thinking should I keep going with this for 
a-couple weeks or months now or should I just uh change 
something up so does do-you just get bloating after you and 
then it kind of goes down uh after a-while yeah but it 
would be more with fiber or in probiotics so yeah yeah 
um-do you eat nuts no I'm right now I'm on strict-carnivore 
just eggs and meat okay okay and how many meals uh per day 
do you-consume I'm doing two at about one and five do you 
have any um fatigue in your-workouts uh no actually since I 
did the carnivore I was on keto before but now-that I'm on 
a carnivore it's even better uh able to train for a 
couple-hours consistently I think you should just you-just 
need to do this longer because it does take a bit of time 
um it sounds-like you do probably have sibo and that you 
have to realize that it's a slow-process sometimes it can 
even take months so some people think it's going-to go away 
right away but what we we want to do is create a shift and 
I think-I'm glad that you're doing two meals a day maybe 
even try sometimes to do one-meal a day just to clear out 
that whole intestinal uh track um to make sure 
that-bacteria um stays where it should um I think you're on 
the right track uh you-just have to do it give it more time 
but then after a couple months uh if you-were going to 
introduce some Fiber I would do um either cooked fiber or 
maybe-a little sour crout um slowly just to see if you 
could test the waters to see-if you can do that um but I 
had I had a similar thing to you um I didn't know-what it 
was I thought it was normal but um yeah it sounds like the 
uh your-microbes are just taking this fiber and fermenting 
them in the wrong-place what did you do for your problem I 
didn't know I didn't get a solution for-about 10 to 20 
years so I I eventually um did a version what you're doing 
and-uh eventually cut out all the the nuts and that seemed 
to to work I don't think-I had it as severe as you though 
but um you know also the quality of of-protein you eat is 
important too you could try like I know that um if you 
had-a choice between chicken or grass-fed red meat I 
definitely do the red meat um-or any type of U meat from 
animals that eat grass versus the grains which is the-pork 
pork and the chicken which is high in Omega 6 which 
is-inflammatory um I don't think you could find pork-that's 
not high omega-6 or even chicken but even eggs might be an 
issue for you-because that's also high in Omega 6 so you 
might do better with um organ meats-or nose to tail maybe 
some um a lot of different um lamb goat and and beef-all 
right so uh my friend we are out of time U but hope that 
works for you and-thanks for a really good call and let's 
see where are we now let's go back to-social media no let's 
not go back to social media let's go to quick 
question-number four which was rapidly answered as usual 
and it asks out of all the N-nutrients uh which are the 
mostly influence excuse me which one mostly-influences 
energy level and 60% of our respondents say it's vitamin 
B12 20% say-it's vitamin B1 10% say it's potassium or 
magnesium and the final 10% say it's-vitamin D okay so when 
we're talking about-energy we're talking about a factory 
called the mitochondria in that-mitochondria you have uh 
assembly lines and you have gears and you have pumps-and 
you have Motors and you have um rotational Motors that 
actually make-what's called ATP it's actually the it's the 
last thing on the chain of events-that makes this ATP it's 
a it's a It's actually an enzyme that actually rotates-as 
fast as a jet engine like 400 times a second each time it 
rotates one time-around produces three ATP that enzyme is 
dependent on one nutrient and this one-is this nutrient is 
the most important for helping you make energy and 
fueling-all the other gears and pumps and Machinery um and 
that is-magnesium so this is why um one of the common 
symptoms of uh magnesium-deficiency could be um fatigue but 
also it could be cramps-because what's happening with 
cramps is you have this this pump that's pushing-calcium in 
and out of the uh the muscles and things like that so if 
you're not-having enough energy to pump that down then you 
get a build up of calcium and-it cramps but magnesium also 
controls the calcium in the cell-so calcium um I mean 
magnesium is so underrated um I recommend the 
calci-Magnesium glycinate um take it before bed and it'll 
help you sleep too U but-it's really important for energy 
controlling too much calcium and also to-allow vitamin D to 
work if you take high amounts of vitamin D over a long 
period-of time without magnesium you create magnesium 
deficiencies-because vitamin D is dependent on this 
magnesium to get it to work so it's one-of those things 
that I I wasn't aware of until um fairly recently of like 
how-many things it's involved with it's so important okay 
very good so our last-routine like this we're going to ask 
quiz question number five then we're-going to go to Kathy 
our final contestant if you will and then we're-going to 
have a marathon on social media so standby folks Here's the 
final-question true or false there evidence to suggest that 
people with a slower-metabolism live longer interesting 
we'll find out about-that all right let's go to uh Kathy 
and let me cut her audio on and we're so-excited to have 
her go ahead Kathy with your brief question for Dr 
Bird-please and I'm excited Dr bur because I got the 
Magnesium question right for the-mitochondria anyway um 
because of em because of emotional and um-mental stress 
throughout my life and low adrenals and uh other things I 
finally-at 76 I said I have my um neurotransmitters tested 
and my doctor-she didn't know what she was doing she just 
looked some stuff up on the-internet and lab cor when I 
went that text have them explain one of their-tests they 
couldn't and the doctors don't seem to but um I was left 
with uh-my dopamine which did not get a um which did not 
get a outof range reference-which is a little triangle and 
critical having a square which I didn't have any-of uh my 
my dopamine is like um minus 30 and the range is 0 to 48 
which I've-also read can be 48 to 50 to 60 and mine's minus 
30 which is not-surprising um and also there's a test I 
didn't understand it's a Gabapentin-serum which my doctor 
kept saying that's a drug Kathy and I didn't sign up 
for-that you had were taking this drug anyway for some 
reason the Gaba Penton-was stried as um out of range not 
critical but out of range and the-reference is 4.0 to 16 
mine's minus one and it says low I have no and that must-be 
Gaba I'm guessing that's Gaba and my one last thing so um 
the-dopamine the Gabapentin serum and the um the epinephine 
it says epinephine is-zero to 62 I'm 23 which I don't know 
and my by the way-my adrenals are always low and um and 
even if I have an angry thought my-adrenals crash I mean 
it's through that so I just wanted to know the 
dopamine-what's standard for that and what I can do and 
which I did go and buy some-tyrosine and I got magnesium 
threonate which all of my cramps in two days are-gone great 
amazing yeah so um so for everyone um she was a patient for 
years-in my clinic in Alexandra Virginia so uh good to see 
you again um so I think I-think you're in the right track 
with magnesium for sure um but like when you-take these 
little factors and we look at them out of context of how 
everything-works it's really hard to figure out what's 
going on but I'm going to you-gave me enough data to to see 
a Common Thread with all three of these because-they all um 
they all relate to uh a deficiency in glutamine which by 
the way-um the best source of glutamine is red meat red 
meat vegetarian oh so this is-you know 45 years so when you 
check when you look at uh metabolomic testing 
that-someone's a veget a vegan sometimes a vegetarian 
it's-literally empty it's like it's just just not enough uh 
um material to come-through to the feed all the different 
nutrients because we're not just talking-about amino acids 
we're talking about all the other nutrients that are 
very-dense in red meat uh so I think you just need to 
switch over to a carnivore no-I'm just kidding um if you 
can't do red meat for some reason I would do-glutamine as a 
supplement glutamine and magnesium as a supplement because 
you'll-that's really what you need to start building up uh 
the-neurotransmitters it wouldn't hurt to to take a prootic 
as well uh because your-microbes produce good um but I 
think think for you glutamine will actually-help you in 
it's also going to help support your adrenals because I 
think-the the adrenaline part thing is compensating for a 
lack of energy in-your mitochondria that's really what 
happens because you your mitochondria is-not generating 
energy so it has to get it from adrenaline so that is 
it's-really hard to uh fix the mitochondria when you can't 
when you're restricted by-putting certain ra raw materials 
in the machine because you're trying to you're-trying to 
run your Ferrari on diesel fuel but it just doesn't quite 
it might-work for a little bit but then it shuts down yeah 
I crave milk and I crave-cheese and I do goats milk and I 
crave cheese but I don't I don't really do it-a lot um milk 
is a little bloating to me the um the Kefir is fine the 
kefir goats-SM kefir because it's fermented it's fine 
cheese is okay but but the goats-milk I have to just have a 
little bit but I crave it and it's and yet I read-the 
dopamine saturated Fat's not good for dopamine but no no no 
no no it is it-dopamine is actually um more of the 
sympathetic Factor so I would uh um I-would definitely do 
more of that cheese raw milk cheese goat cheese I would 
do-more of that it's not going to be bad for you it's going 
to help you greatly-because it gives you you source of uh 
amino acids protein probiotics B-vitamins trace minerals so 
yeah do that that's great-well thanks so much Kathy for a 
great call we're out of time but uh we uh hope-that that 
helps and let's go on quiz question number the final one 
Kathy I-hope you get this it asks true false there is 
evidence to suggest that people-with a slower metabolism 
live longer and uh 62% of our respondents say that's-true 
and 38% say in no way it is false doc what say there some 
interest there's-some interesting evidence that say it's 
true because-um a slow metabolism really is an 
efficient-metabolism and those of us that had a 
slower-metabolism way back in the day actually survived 
because we could run on a-smaller amount of fuel for a 
longer period of time now if you take someone-with a slow 
metabolism and you feed them modern Foods they're not going 
to live-long but if they actually get on a healthy program 
they have a better um-they're better at um dealing with 
energy they're more efficient with the-energy so they're 
also uh more adapt to do more fasting as well whereas 
someone-with a faster metabolism doesn't do as well 
with-fasting so there's one advant manag to having a slow 
metabolism at least one-right so I'm going to do a video on 
some of-the maybe the genetics that were dealt with-um and 
some of the advantages and disadvantages of what like if 
you were-if you have genes that are more pro-inflammatory 
uh your risk for cancer-goes down so there's always this 
tradeoff um and I'm going to talk about-that in a future 
video I think it's going to be interesting all right 
very-good as promised we're going to do a marathon on 
social media this is all-we're going to talk about for the 
rest of the show so let's go to Julia from-YouTube what is 
your recommended recommendation for daily dosage 
of-magnesium glycinate for women minimally uh about 400 
um-milligrams okay if you're just trying to M maintain it 
but if if you if you're-trying to use it for any type of 
therapeutic thing like inflammation-sleep problems uh 
muscle cramping then double the doses-do dosage to 800 
milligrams um there's not necessarily A Toxic effect if 
you-take too much because your body will get rid of excess 
but of course there might-be a you might feel nauseous 
diarrhea if you take massive amounts but the reason-I like 
the Magnesium glycinate is because the glycinate is glycine 
which-helps other things especially for stress and 
sleep-and um you don't get the diarrhea like 
magnesium-oxide so that's why okay apparently there's a new 
phenomenon on YouTube-where popup ads keep popping up and 
interrupting Dr Berg's uh monologue and-so on and our 
producer Terry wanted to remind you that you can go back 
and look-at it after the fact hopefully they won't be there 
and if they are then you-can go look at it at face on 
Facebook or Rumble so we apologize for that and we-hope 
that um YouTube stops it so you'll have to uh remind me 
Steve uh we need to-remove the the ads off of this live 
show oh good so we have iritating way to do-it all right 
very good so we're on it audience stand by Julia from 
YouTube uh-no we already did that one let's see Mike from 
YouTube what are your thoughts-on taking St John's wart for 
depression I think it's a great-alternative um I mean it it 
creates a similar effect anti-depressants but-without all 
the side however uh doctors don't like you to-take it if 
you're on uh ssris at the same time because it can really 
um alter-your serotonin in the wrong direction so that 
being said if you're-not on an SSRI then I think it'd be a 
great solution if you argue with your-doctor to see if if 
it's okay to take both because I think what happens-whether 
you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol or 
depression or-whatever or anxiety and you're on a 
medication for that people like to also-do Alternatives of 
the same time and even if you're like you're a diabetic-and 
you take berberine with your metformin and now your blood 
sugar-becomes low and you go to the doctor and they go oh 
my gosh your blood sugar you-have hypoglycemia we need to 
give you sugar pills uh why don't we just cut-down the meds 
I mean it's like duh I mean what what isn't the goal to 
wean-you off medication over time um for some reason we 
think that this medication is-normal that we have to take 
it and it's just managing our symptoms for the rest-of our 
life and this is the way it's going to be I'm like no I 
thought like-can't we get rid of it um most conditions you 
can so anyway-I just wanted to mention that all right 
here's an interesting question from brlp-from Rumble uh can 
you please discuss how our emotions and beliefs can play 
a-part in maintain good health or destroying it maybe I 
think it's a-superior thing um if you notice people that 
are up on the emotional scale of-things they're literally 
immune uh to infections and bacteria and yeast and-things 
they they just don't get body problems and if they do they 
kind of-have nine lives and they just they can survive 
better so uh I even noticed in-practice those people that 
are um lower on the emotional scale have a lot more-health 
problems so do what you can to keep yourself high on the 
emotional-scale whether it's going for long walks in the in 
nature get doing busy with-work around the yard very very 
important okay Renee from Facebook would-horseradish help 
reverse or eradicate spider veins huh I think it's a 
good-thing good thing that can help uh Rish in general are 
really good for um-circulation arteries veins things like 
that so I I just I can't consume-horseradish uh I wish I 
could but I can't so I I'll get i'll get my-nutrition other 
ways all right very good L from YouTube what do I get why 
do I-get the shakes every time I break a fast I think what 
you're eating um-hopefully it's not too many carbs um but I 
think I would go smaller and more Gra-gradual because when 
you do a fast uh you really alter your biochemistry 
and-your hormones and um and then all of a sudden you push 
it back and things can-have have have to adjust so I would 
have smaller meals and um go into it a little-bit easier 
until your body can fully handle this this is really called 
uh-metabolic flexibility we're able to you know change your 
fuel go in and out of-fasting and go back to meals you know 
that takes some time to work that muscle-okay Moxy from 
YouTube would kefir help reduce-bloating maybe maybe not 
depending if you have sibo small intestinal 
bacteria-overgrowth it'll make it worse because a probiotic 
like you're going to add more-bacteria in there but I I 
like kefir because it has more microbes than yogurt-and for 
me it doesn't bloat me but also realize that you could be 
allergic to-the casine in the milk which could bloat you or 
even the-lactose this is why they have lactose-free uh 
kefir or they might have-a better source of kefir it' be 
sheep Che sheep milk um kefir or even goat-milk kefir if 
you can find that that would be a little bit-better okay uh 
Jennifer from Facebook what are the best food and 
supplements-for someone and there are many without a 
gallbladder I would probably take a bile-salt um after your 
meal I would also take U-maybe some tutka in the middle of 
the meal just to keep that thing cleaned out-um realize 
that you may end up being deficient in the fat cble 
vitamins in-which case you need to take them right so you 
can don't forget um that also-includes omega-3 fatty acids 
as in DHA so you may benefit from taking um not a-lot but 
just some cive oil which will give you vitamin A and D and 
then also-uh vitamin E and even K2 which is actually a lot 
of times that's already-in the vitamin D supplement so it's 
one of those things you just have to see if-it's creating a 
deficiency or not if you have enough to um extract these 
fat CYO-vitamins or not all right well Anthony has a tough 
and familiar problem he's-writing us from Facebook what 
would you recommend to someone who has severe-facial acne 
well I'm an expert in it um because I've-had it really bad 
so the first thing you want to do is cut down the sugar 
and-refined carbs because that's creating higher androgens 
and androgens make the-sebaceous gland the oil gland 
enlarged and produce more oil which then feeds-bacteria and 
the whole cycle cles on and on so low carb will usually 
handle the-acne there's other nutrients too that are 
beneficial for acne like um vitamin-E like vitamin D this 
is why the sun is great for acne um but scrubbing your-skin 
and try and popping your zits are very bad for acne um or 
putting lotions-in or synthetic uh vitamin A which is um 
what is that what's that called um that-retinol yeah like 
retinoic um what's it uh there's some medication I 
can't-remember but it's the vitamin A in high potency I 
think the might have banned-it Wow Let's squeeze one more 
in andz from YouTube which nutrient deficiency-could cause 
uh my um let's see rapid involuntary eye movement uh-nagus 
yeah that's it that's usually a B1 deficiency um it could 
also involve um-B12 but it's usually B1 so take more B1 and 
on that note thank you for watching-I will see you uh next 
week same time same place-[Music]
