and to double click on that cuz you kind of at the end 
there mentioned where I-feel like a lot of times when 
longevity and that word gets thrown around it is-on the how 
long you live side um so I think it's worth double clicking 
why do-you think it's so important for someone to not only 
care about how long they-live the lifespan side but also 
the healthspan side that you said there and-also how well 
they live there are several reasons for this-to be relevant 
um you know first you can think of this-kind of at the 
level of just a thought experiment right so in the in the 
in the-book I write about the Greek god tonus and how he 
wished for-immortality um he was of course granted his wish 
but because he had forgot to-ask for uh Eternal youth he 
became you know this uh you know in indefinitely-suffering 
human being who continued to age in perpetuity while his 
body-declined so I I think just sort of theoretically I 
think anybody who thinks-about it for long enough would 
realize that any desire to live longer has to 
be-accompanied by a desire to preserve Health span so I 
believe that anybody-who thinks they want to live to be 200 
implicit within that I hope is the-desire to function as 
someone who is much younger right if I if if if if if 
a-person says to me I want to live to be 95 well I'm 
assuming and if not we'll-tease this out I'm assuming they 
don't want to look like most 95 year olds-right what I 
assume is I want to live to be 95 but I would hope that in 
the final-years of my life I function like a 75y old right 
a healthy 75y old so so so so-that's why I think the second 
thing here is and the reason at least for me that-Health 
span is such an important focus and we're going to talk I'm 
sure about-medicine 2.0 versus medicine 3.0 but one of the 
most-important Concepts within medicine 3.0 is an equal 
obsession with health span-as lifespan and again Health 
span by itself-is valuable at any given age whether it's 40 
50 70 or-80 to for your age age have better physical uh a 
better physical body a-better cognitive mind better 
emotional health always exceeds being below it-it's so 
self-evident it doesn't require stating it secondly all the 
things that-you do to improve your health span are twofers 
and anybody who works for me-knows what a twer is and a 
three-fer and a fourer and how much I hate one fers so-a 
twer means you're getting a two for the price of one so 
when you do all-those things to improve your health span 
you are also improving your lifespan you-could make a case 
that most of the benefits in um lifespan uh roughly I-would 
say 3/4 of the benefits you can get towards a longer life 
come solely-from pursuing Better Health I want to say that 
again because-I think it is I I for me at least it's such a 
profound statement if you never-thought once about trying 
to live a longer life and focused relentlessly on-how can I 
improve my strength my endurance my stamina my you know 
and-again all the Nuance around these things my balance my 
coordination my processing-speed uh my working memory my 
emotional health my happiness my relationship if-you if you 
only focused on those things and never once thought about 
heart-disease cancer Alzheimer's disease specifically I 
still believe you would-capture 3/4 of the way towards 
optimizing your lifespan again I think-it's a bold 
statement I can't confirm that that's exactly correct right 
I mean-that's not that's not a studable-winter is valuable 
in its own-right even if it didn't lengthen life at all and 
the fact is it probably does and-it probably does to a 
greater effect than all of the efforts that 
largely-medicine 2.0 puts directly into lifespan
