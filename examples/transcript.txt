maybe you think the pr maybe is too high for me uh then we 
can adjust a little-bit maybe we reduce our coverage maybe 
we shorter of term maybe we put longer-premium terms do you 
know which insurance you should get are you paying-too much 
for your insurance should you cut your ILP meet the who 
helps to-manage me and my family's Insurance the special 
thing about him is that he is an-insurance broker where 
he's not tied out to just one insurance company instead 
he-has access to different insurance companies here in 
Singapore so he gets-to always pick the best insurance 
among different companies and in this video-he'll be 
answering all your burning questions about insurance so to 
when is-the best time to start buying Insurance okay here 
is some general guidelines-depend on different type of 
insurance the firstly we talk about health-insurance 
normally for locals or PR us they buy health insurance for 
their-child when the child is 14 days old okay why 14 days 
old this one is a minimum-entry age for health insurance so 
we can tell that we need to get a health-insurance as soon 
as possible for foreigners normally they will get 
their-health insurance once they decide to stay in 
Singapore for a long term okay-secondly we talk about life 
insurance for life insurance is uh more important-when you 
have your dependents who relies on your income or any 
Financial-applications like mortgage loan or any other 
debits like if I have a family-then I get life insurance uh 
yes because like life insurance normally is replace-our 
incomes okay so if you have dependence relies on your 
income you-should get the life insurance rather than later 
but what if like I don't have-enough money like if I 
graduated from University I don't have a lot of pay 
uh-which insurance should I get first I would say health 
insurance because the-health insurance protect us from high 
medical cost okay without a health-insurance uh it can be 
uh Financial burdensome if you suffer any hospital-stays or 
surgeries the health insurance cover up to 95% of your 
hospital bill-okay but there's some limitations that you 
need to be Hospital state or surgery-if like just uh like 
uh you go Clinic uh you do not have any treatment 
or-surgeries then cannot uh claim must fulfill one of 
either Hospital stay or-surgery okay but what if I have 
like cancer they go for Hospital checkup does-it cover for 
health insurance because the health insurance is cover uh 
pre and-post for the hospital stat as well so let's say we 
do a checkup for the-cancers then after that I have been 
advised to be water in the hospital so-the pre check also 
can be covered okay and also the followup and can be 
covered-as well okay but there's a time limit okay so the 
health insurance is most-important uh yes correct okay okay 
so moving on to like life insurance should-I get term 
insurance insance or whole life because some people say 
that you-invest ter by the rest then what is the whole life 
for okay it's a very common-question I always been asked 
from my client a term or whole life firstly we-talk about 
term plan okay term plan is just cover a specific term okay 
maybe-like 10 years 20 years or 30 years you can choose by 
yourself but after that-specific term no more coverage for 
for you and the premium is more affordable-compared to 
Whole Life why because temp plan don't have any cash value 
so the-money you pay you can't even get $1 back from 
insurance company then we talk-about the whole life plan of 
course as the name shows whole life plan is a-whole life 
plan can cover you for your entire life but the premium 
just just-now at top it's much higher than 10 plan because 
uh part of the premiums goes to-accumulate the cash value 
uh So eventually if you don't want this plan-you want to 
surrender at least you can get some money back that's the 
main part-and of course if you want to High coverage the 
premium will be very high-but how do I choose between the 
two term or H not a fixed answer to choose a term-of whole 
life if let's say I want a whole life coverage but for a 
specific-time because I have a children right now for past 
20 years or 30 years I need a-higher coverage so we can mix 
a match so let's see we can mix a match for the-whole life 
plan and turn plan M if let's say I buy a less coverage for 
a whole-life plan and the boost for or higher coverage in 
next 30 years it's a way to-solve our problems so there's 
not uh must buy one of them uh we can do mix-and match to 
fulfill our needs okay so for term plan right you mentioned 
it's-only for like 10 to 30 years then for people who buy 
ter right after that 30-years right there's no more 
coverage like is that a bad thing yes it's real-it's a bad 
thing but normally it depends just how we talk about 
financial needs-if you need a financial coverage for your 
dependent Maybe your mortgage I-think both of them time 
range maybe my case will be grow up in next 20 or 30-years 
my mortgage will be paid off by next uh 25 or 30 years so 
after that I-do not have so much Financial applications so 
I I do not need that-higher coverage I can shorter them so 
I can buy a less coverage of the whole-life plan so it's to 
replace the loss of income during that period oh yes so 
like-let's say if you have retired your house all paid off 
your k have all grown up-then you don't need that High 
coverage okay quick pause if you are looking to-trade

your investing to the next level do sign out to weo 
using-my link down below all right let's get back to the 
video how much should I-spend on insurance like like what's 
the percentage of salary or do you look by-coverage instead 
normally we calculate this based on coverage just I 
mentioned-if you have dependence you have morgage L and 
maybe you have older parents to-take care to support their 
daily life so we calculate all these of your 
financial-needs and we do a calculation about the whole 
coverage you need and based on the-coverage you need how 
long the term you need we come out a premium then 
maybe-using the premium maybe is too high for me uh then we 
can adjust a little bit-maybe we reduce our coverage maybe 
we shorter our term maybe we put longer-premium terms we 
can adjust it based on our budget so for like plan right 
is-there a formula to know what is the correct coverage 
normally is about 10-times our annual income but also 
depends how much that be you have but maybe your-mortgage R 
is left a lot you need to make sure you are cover for that 
as well-so it's a plus minus things for health insurance is 
no uh such range to choose-it's just to choose what type of 
plan you need or to cover up to Private-Hospital or 
government hospital is enough what normally people choose 
if-youing the premium you can't afford Lear recommend you 
to go with a private-Hospital coverage the time efficiency 
for a appointment or whatever surgery-need to be arranged I 
think Private Hospital is much faster than government-and 
of course the hospital bill is much higher I think at least 
two to three-times higher than government hospital that's 
why the premium is two to three-times of your government 
Hospital premium as well so because you want to-see the 
doctor faster you're more willing to pay more for the 
comfort also-and maybe some of them they like the 
environment of the hospital as well-right like you can stay 
in a single B room or like sh room kind yes correct-what 
about like accident Insurance uh what's the courage do I 
need the-accident insurance is about medical reimbursement 
of your accident cause uh-maybe you cut your finger you do 
a simple treatment in the clinics that one-can cover by 
accident plan but not covered by Hospital plan because 
the-health insurance is only covered as the hospital days 
or surgeries so the normal-treatment cannot be covered by 
Hospital plan that's why we need a accient plan-for those 
type of treatment just now I mention you cut your fingers 
your fall-down uh anything related to this we can claim as 
a accident plan what cage do we-need for the accident plan 
normally I just mention to my clients I think the-first 
tier should be okay basically you just want the cage that 
yes the-reimbursement part is about 2,000 of the your 
medical reimbursement the one is I-think it's more than 
enough for accident let's say if I like fall down go into 
a-car accident will this pay out for the accident depends 
whether you have been-wed in the hospital or not if big 
injury you need to be wed in the hospital or-you need do 
some surgeries it will be covered by your health insurance 
if like-minor injury I just need to go to clinic uh do a 
simple treatment then it be-covered by accident plan canot 
claim both at the same time yes definitely-canot okay 
that's that so other than Health accident and life 
insurance What-other insurance should you get normally we 
talk about insurance there are two-type of insurance I will 
talk to my client one is protection the other one-is wealth 
accumulation uh I separate is two separately okay so for 
protection-wise only the three Insurance Health accident 
and life life uh includes death-tpd and critical ESS and 
the other part weth accumulation is about 
savings-investment so if we talk about protection this Tre 
is enough for okay-so the next question is that normal 
people can buy insurance but what if I-have a pre-existing 
condition and I'm excluded from buying Insurance what can-I 
do for protection okay I got some of these cases as well my 
clients got-reject by insurance companies due to some 
conditions firstly we need to know-what conditions you have 
and that one can be fully recovered or maybe get-better or 
not so if let's see currently you are suffering a existing 
condition-but it can be fully recovered by some treatment 
maybe next year then we can do-a appeal of these 
applications based on medical report and like doctor memos 
to-show that you are fully recovered with uh these 
conditions all get better so we-can fight with insurance 
companies to buy in Insurance okay uh and for the-worst 
case the situation is really bad we can't buy insurance to 
cover our like-death benefits or critical un benefit or 
even health insurance then we should-looking for other risk 
management tools because insurance is just a 
risk-management tools if something happen it can covers me 
so if we can't buy a-insurance to cover us maybe we need to 
do some savings do some investment to-accumulation our 
wealth just in case something happen we can afford it 
so-it's the other part of the insurance like the wealth 
accumulation part yes-the part of insurance you do not need 
underwriting because it's a wealth-accumulation so you 
either buy insurance to cover that part or you do your 
own-investment to to cover that part that's correct okay 10 
so the other thing is-insurance is expensive now is there 
any way that I can save on insurance okay I-think there's 
two points for saving your insurance cost the first point 
is we-need to check whether we are over covered because 
just now we mention-about accident plan uh I got some cases 
like once I review my client's policy-hey I noted that they 
have two or three action plan in one time I as them why 
oh-they say okay uh my friends is doing insurance I suppor 
my buy one ex plan-from him by one accident from others 
then I asked them do you know that for-the medical 
reimburse part no matter how many accident plan you have 
you can just-claim one oh not from different companies yes 
you can just claim one so-even you have two or three it's 
with your money when is enough this one is-the first point 
whether you are over covered okay the second point is 
once-you buying a insurance let's say health insurance or 
accident insurance or life-insurance whether you have 
compare different companies for the same cover-maybe you'll 
buy a life insurance for maybe 500k coverage you'll pay 
$1,000-but I pay $800 maybe the other guy they pay $700 for 
same coverage for same Poli-term why because we're choosing 
the lowest one from different companies okay-uh so that is 
one part is to do comparisons how come different 
companies-have different premium for different coverage 
okay because there's a lot-insurance companies in Singapore 
okay there's not one company have all best-products in one 
time if that things happen the other insurer cannot 
survive-as well so they have different Focus areas uh maybe 
company a they focus on-life insurance so the the life 
insurance do very well uh the premium thejust is-Affordable 
and the coverage is high but for other insurers they may 
focus on-health insurance they may focus on investment they 
may focus on life-insurance so normally we choose the best 
product from each companies uh we can-mix and match we 
don't need to buy one insurance from one company 
that's-interesting because like when we buy insurance most 
of the time we buy from-friends or we buy from agents at 
Road shows which are from just one company so-it's hard to 
know that you have the best plan yes that's why normally we 
looking-for different companies with uh insurance broker 
they can present most-of the insurance at one time so they 
can do a compare for them and choose one of-the best but 
the coverage part like everything is exactly the same or is 
it-that there are some Parts they are not inside like a 
insurance has this B-insurance doesn't have this part have 
this case as well so we need to go-through the fully 
comparisons not only press also the coverage as well 
but-let's say for temp plan for death or tpd coverage it's 
almost same death is death-dbd is dbd if let's see talk 
about critical unit maybe a little bit-difference maybe 
company a have more type of un they cover Company B 
have-less then we need to know that the extra part whether 
we need to pay extra money-for that part or no need to pay 
it's by you but the most common unites are all-covered uh 
yes correct yeah it's just the more rarer part yes and also 
some-maybe some special terms okay uh special benefits so 
we need to decide that-whether we okay for pay extra money 
for that part okay uh if we okay then cannot-okay so this 
is a common question that I always see online the friend 
has so him-and IP then after reading online I see that IP 
is expensive like what should I-do should I just cut for 
plans is very popular in past I think five or 10 
years-before part of your premium goes to production part 
of your premium goes to-a investment account and if you ask 
me whether you need to cut or hold it-depends on the timing 
you buying depend on the ratios that protection how 
many-percent uh investment how many percent also depend on 
the market okay okay so-normally I need to read through the 
full policy details you have then we decide-whether we hold 
or cut or hold sometime then cut what are you looking for 
if you-are playing The Hole uh the factors we need to look 
into is just now I mention-the ratio of the protections or 
investment let's say if you pay $100 for-this plan okay how 
much premium goes to prodection side if let's say your $90 
go-to prodection side only $10 goes to investment plan 
definitely the plan-finally will lost oh yeah because the 
premium will go up over it will go up-year by year okay and 
finally the prodection set will over $100 which you-pay and 
then the money will be withdraw from your investment 
account and your-money will be less and less so we need to 
focus on timing as well the ratio as-well and also your 
investment return as well if your investment return is 
really-high to cover your prodection then also good so 
variable factors currently for-this Market okay this type 
of ips is uh out of Market as well but I think most-of the 
agency do not sell this type of insurance because the 
client feedback-they losing money that feedbacks currently 
we s investment plan is pure-investment plan protection is 
like ter a whole life like pure production T so-it's sep so 
long story short whether to hold or cut you should see a 
few more-factors like so it's not just cut straight away 
you can see like the ratio-what's the market doing right 
now and how much you paying for the plan yes-because the 
younger you buy the lp the lower cost of insurance you pay 
so most-of your money goes to investment part if you're too 
old to buy a then most of-your premium goes to production 
site okay yeah no more investment you just-buy the the 
coverage part yes correct if an insurance agent comes up to 
me on the-street then what should I do so I think for you 
if you really don't have a-financial agent with you or 
you're really looking for some insurance I-think you can 
listen to them they can give you some useful informations 
as-well and uh if let's say if you really know time you 
have your insurance uh-already or you have your insurance 
agent as well then you just tell them nicely-because as a 
financial agent I know that the road show is a really tough 
job for-them as well they need to stand outside for a whole 
day pach everybody who-working through and I think 90 or 
80% of them they'll be reject but let's say if-I want to 
meet an insurance agent whether it's my friend whether it's 
from-Road show uh how do I better prepare myself before I 
meet them firstly you-need to clear that what type of 
insurance you need you need a health-insurance or you need 
a life insurance or you need a accident Insurance okay-and 
secondly is whether you need a savings or investment and 
during the-midu you need to ask for proof that what the 
ageny normally they say oh this a-production plan oh no 
cash values or have cash values say oh it's a free 
plan-because maybe five or 10 years later you can get your 
money back or whatever so-you need to ask for brand at 
White the contract was to see that and once you-are buying 
a like see savings plan or investment plan they say oh the 
return-is very high 4% or 8% you need to ask is a guarantee 
or Project Return uh you-need to know because once you buy 
a first 4% is really high I okay I buy-after year by year 
you see the the return is not that 4% it's maybe 2% or-or 
3% why because the 4% may be a project return uh so you 
need to know-the what is guaranteed or Not Guaranteed is a 
risk free one or you have RIS one-okay it's like savings or 
investment because some of my client they say I-have a 
saving plan after I go R through their policies I it's not 
a receiving-plan investment so they may lost money so no 
matter the agency just see black-white going through the 
whole process they need to show you the contract Wass-is 
there any way I can calculate my own coverage to know what 
I really need-rather than listen to the agent to tell me 
what I need okay firstly just now I-is about your 
dependence okay your debits and maybe uh your old parents 
who-relies on you so you plus all this and also depends on 
your annual income-annual expense as well if your expense 
is high then you need more coverage your-expense is low 
then you need lower coverage for example if your income 
is-100k but your annual expense is only 50k or your annual 
expense is 80k your-annual experience is 30k it's also 
different so normally we calculate is-based on annual 
expense income is there like a guideline that say 
Insurance-expense should not exceed how much of my annual 
income okay normally it is my own-calculation normally I 
will ask my clients not exist 20% but 20% is really-a very 
high ra yeah but normally for protection only I think 10% 
will be-enough as well 10% can buy enough coverage for for 
you uh maybe the other-10% is doing like saving R 
accumulation should I review my insurance are every-year is 
is is there a need to okay basically I recommend that you 
review-your policy once your life state is change because 
when you fresh graduate I-believe that you buy some of your 
insurance but once you get married you-get dependence I 
think the more coverage you need uh and once you buy a 
house you-got a housing loan I think the more cover you 
need as well after your-retirement or you're going to 
retirement you need to plan for your retirement-well so 
different life stage you have different needs so we need to 
go through-to re R the policy once your life stage is 
changed I think that's all for this-interview if you guys 
need a second opinion on your insurance coverage or-your 
existing Insurance you can uh contact him I will leave his 
link down-below I think the good thing about him is that 
he's an insurance broker so he-can help you to compare many 
different plans not just one insurance so I think-that's 
all bye
