hi this is Patrick from sth today we have a quick tip for 
getting started-with proxmox ve which is how to download an 
ISO directly to the host we get-questions on this 
frequently and have seen a lot of creative ways to do 
this-we wanted to share an easy way to load ISOs and this 
is one that we've used for-years this task essentially has 
three easy steps first you need to change the-directory 
second you find the URL of the eye so that you want to 
download and-then you just double you get and wait okay 
let's get started when you first-install proxmox ve one of 
the first features you want to try is creating a-KVM 
virtual machine as you progress through the vm creation 
menus one of the-first snags you'll hit is that you need to 
have an ISO for installation media-we're gonna head over to 
a terminal which we've logged into on a proxmox ve-host and 
change the directory to VAR live easy template I so this is 
the-local path that proxmox ve looks to for local ISO 
images you can also put them-on the network but we want to 
get going fast so we're gonna start here from here-we need 
to get the ISO name and download it but to has a fairly 
easy ISO naming-structure so we can simply use URL of a 
silly one and W get and we can wait a-few seconds and the 
image will be downloaded when this finishes we can now-go 
back to the web user interface and create a VM using Ubuntu 
image that we-just download We strongly suggest making your 
first vm a template so that way you-don't have to install 
from ISO every time and we have a guide for that on SDH-if 
you want to see that having one ISO is great and a bunt too 
is popular but-you probably will want to have at least sent 
OS as well here we can go to the-center web page select a 
mirror and in this case we are gonna give a shout-out-to 
Quadra net for hosting the LAX mirror and we're gonna grab 
that mirror URL and-now we can W get the ISO after again 
waiting a few seconds we can head back-to the web UI and 
now we see that we have two popular Linux-distribution I 
chose to work with you can repeat this process as needed 
and we-have seen folks even script downloading multiple 
ISOs to make the process even-easier you're likely going to 
want to swap two templates rather than-installing from Isis 
each time however it is handy to have Isis locally when-you 
get into pinch and you just need to do something fast as 
you get more-advanced you may also want to add Isis on a 
network data store so that way you-can save on your storage 
costs as you have started with proxmox this is an-easy way 
to clear the first hurdle for making VMs thank you for
