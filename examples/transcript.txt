welcome welcome R welcome to this late autumn event at the 
Free Press society-tonight we are happy and honored to 
welcome author historian and pit Raymond-Ibrahim Raymond 
Ibrahim is the author of among other books sord citar 
crucified-again and Defenders of the West and he has 
written countless important articles-about Islam's war 
against the west and everybody else for that-matter many of 
which the Free Press society has shamelessly published 
over-the years one of ibrahim's central points is-that 
Islam's war against the West cannot be regarded as single 
isolated Wars-based on specific disagreement but should be 
regarded as an ongoing-religious war of Conquest with the 
ultimate goal of subjugating the entire-world to Islam the 
Muslim persecution of-Christians should always be 
interpreted in this-perspective the Danish government is 
currently introducing new laws to curb-freedom of free 
speech and restrict criticism of Islam in order to 
appease-pressure from the same Islamic countries whose own 
Christian minorities have been-ruthlessly persecuted for 
years before I give uh the floor to-Raymond Ibrahim just a 
few remarks uh of the course of the evening Raymond-Ibrahim 
will speak for approximately 45 minutes after which there 
will be a-break and here you can have a cup of coffee or a 
glass of wine and then we'll-meet here again for the second 
half where you will have the opportunity to-ask G and I him 
questions and make comments we end the meeting uh no 
later-than 9:30 so without further Ado I'll give-the floor 
to Raymond welcome-thank you all very much I hope you don't 
mind if I sit down so I can access my uh-computer okay 
first I'm very happy to be here and thank you to everyone 
who-helped organize this event um a and um Eben who helped 
uh make it happen I'm-very happy to be here very important 
topic as we can see um so my-understanding is the main 
pressing topic we're talking about today that is 
I'm-talking about and you're asking me about is the 
persecution of Christians-throughout the world what it is 
how it's happening why it's happening etc-etc and this by 
the way is a very uh near and dear to my own heart topic 
why-because my family are persecuted Christians um so I 
think I should start-with a little bit of my own background 
I was born and raised in the United States-my parents are 
from Egypt they're they're what's called Coptic 
Christians-which are the indigenous Christian inhabitants 
of Egypt who predate the-Muslims by many centuries actually 
and so growing up um I was already aware-even though I was 
living here in the United States of what was 
happening-there and I understood it and I heard it and um I 
ended up gravitating and-studying col in college kind of 
these topics I majored in history and I dealt-with the 
Nexus of U uh of the uh conflict between Islam and the 
Western-world Europe Christendom precisely um so even in in 
2000 or 1999-when I was writing my Master's thesis it was 
about the first pivotal battle-between Muslims and 
Christians the Byzantine Empire as we call it in the-year 6 
636 and that's when 9/11 happened a year later and um I 
ended up-continuing my studies uh going to Georgetown and 
other-universities and working at the Library of Congress 
and this was really my job-Islam radical Islam etc etc and 
my early books dealt with Al-Qaeda-and translations from 
Arabic um but then probably around 2006 and 7 I 
started-gravitating to this topic because like I said it's 
important to me personally-it's part of my uh background 
and Heritage so I've really been writing and-researching 
about this topic of Islam Muslim persecution of Christians 
since-probably 2006 and I my first book dedicated to 
it-came out in 2013 it's called crucified again exposing 
Islam's new war on-Christians and even before that and I'll 
talk a little more about it because it's-applicable but 
I've been writing a report called Muslim persecution 
of-Christians and I produce it every month and what I do is 
I just go as far you-know I find all the reports on not 
mainstream media because they don't talk-about it but 
alternative media foreign language media of Muslims 
persecuting-Christians On Any Given month and um I put it 
together and I collect it since-20 so if you do the math uh 
it's been 12-years time 12 it's about 144 reports each one 
of them being about 4,000-words and the funny thing is when 
I first envisioned this idea I thought to-myself this is 
kind of ambitious you want to write a monthly report 
about-Christians being persecuted what what if a month 
comes and there's nothing or-just some minor story sadly 
that's never been a problem and I'm at a point now-where I 
have so much information that I don't use all of it I only 
try to get-the most um you know the most relevant aspect so 
it's a nonstop habitual-systematic issue which we can talk 
about um and like I said you know for my own-family 
extended family have to various degrees understood this and 
another-reason I'm involved in this because I think the 
Western public in general is-completely ignorant about it 
after all if I tell someone today I'm a copt the-first 
question I get is which police precinct do you work for 
okay so you can-imagine um so what I'd like to do is uh 
start off with a little statistics just-to give you an idea 
of how bad the situation is because you're not going 
to-hear it from the mainstream media obviously and then 
we'll talk about why-that is because that of course itself 
is very important and telling to why this-is happening so 
there's a lot of organizations who um collate 
information-and data about this particular topic of 
Christian persecution and they're pretty-um you know 
impeccable they're they're trusted even by 
non-Christian-organizations and I'm using one of the most 
conservative numbers so there's-other peoples who will give 
you bigger numbers but this group which is called-open 
doors it's an international organization and they have 
every year-they publish something called the world watch 
list they've been doing this for-decades and uh what it is 
is they rank the top 50 nations in the world 
where-Christians are being persecuted by rank so the first 
of of the 50 is the worst-and the last of the 50 is not so 
bad but it's still terrible compared to what you-would 
expect according to Modern Standard decency towards 
human-rights so according to this report the most recent 
one which came out in 2023-but it deals with the year 
2022-5,621 Christians around the world were killed for 
their faith now that's-different that some people may think 
that's not a big number but what that-means is they were 
actually killed because they were Christians 
because-someone someone targeted a Chris church and bombed 
it while they were there or-because it was a woman and 
she's Christian and they figured she's easy-prey and they 
raped her and killed her a lot of that happens too so 
that's that-number the number is actually significantly 
bigger if you talk about-just Christians being killed and 
slaughtered but then the element arises-which is well we 
don't know if the Muslim who killed the Christian was-doing 
it just because of a religion maybe it was something 
personal okay but-the 4,000 uh or the 5,621 those were 
Bonafide documented-cases of just Christians being murdered 
because of their religion that's a big-number can you 
imagine what the world would say if 5,621 Muslims were 
killed-in Europe because of their religion it would be a 
story but here it's not of-course and there's other 
statistics uh according to that same report 360 
Mill-million Christians now that's a bigger number are not 
being killed but they are-suffering quote high levels of 
discrimination and violence in the-Islamic world again this 
is not something this isn't um you know someone-in Denmark 
feeling that someone's giving him a dirty look because he's 
Muslim-discrimination persecution this is very real this is 
like you don't get a job-you get pushed out of a 
neighborhood whatever you know just really and very-open 
and violent stuff that OB obviously impacts the life of 
the-Christian and then a little more um kind of a de a 
demographic dispersion so on-average in the world according 
to this most recent and I as I said conservative-report one 
in seven Christians in the whole world which is 14% are 
persecuted-severely okay in Africa subsaharan Africa that 
number grows to one in five-So 20% of the Christians in 
Africa are being severely persecuted in Asia it's 2-and 
five okay which is 40% of all Christians are being 
persecuted there-all right and it's and you know we can get 
into the you know and I will to a-certain extent you know 
the the the you know the more kind of details of what-this 
means what persecution means but and it comes down if you 
boil-it down according to this most recent again very 
credible report 15.4 or as-you can say between 15 and 16 
Christians are are murdered for their faith every-day in 
this world that sounds like a problem you'd think that's 
something-that we could talk about on the news but of 
course it that's not even something-we're going to talk 
about at all and I'll I'll get into that also why 
and-what's also interesting is that I've um I've uh I've 
been looking at this for-years like I mentioned so I'm 
giving you the most recent tall from 2023 but if-you look 
at it as I have from since 2015 till now that number just 
continuously-keeps growing okay so in the most recent year 
I told you 360 million Christians-were being experience uh 
experiencing high levels of persecution and-discrimination 
in 20 um in 2019 it was only 245 million okay from 360 so 
that's-uh based on the math that I did at the time that's a 
jump of 70% in just a-handful of years so where are we 
going with this and new countries keep being-added to the 
list so it's now last I Read 50 is not enough we have to 
add-more you have random countries like Nicaragua which is 
actually now seen as-a persecutor of Christians which may 
sound-counterintuitive because nicaragu you would think was 
a Catholic Nation but-and we'll get into you know all the 
the Myriad factors that exacerbate the-situation for 
Christians now again I'm still talking about this 
particular-report in the top 11 Nations okay and in these 
nations the the the worst 11-Nations these are the Nations 
where if you're seen as a Christian you're a free-game you 
might get killed murdered arrested imprisoned raped beat 
whatever-okay these are 11 Nations um and I'll read them to 
you so the first-interestingly is North Korea and then 
second is Somalia third Yemen fourth-eretria fifth Libya 
sixth Nigeria seventh Pakistan 8 n eight Iran 
N9-Afghanistan 10 Sudan and 11 India to be a Christian to 
those countries is like a-death warrant now what's 
interesting to me if you're paying attention to 
these-countries is I just I just mentioned 11 nine of them 
are Muslim nations okay so-I think that right there starts 
indicating who's the lon share of the-persecutors North 
Korea obviously is not um of these numbers of the 11 
I-mentioned North Korea is not and India is not so the 
first one North Korea is-not and India 11th is not the rest 
are all Islamic Nations now if you extend-this to the 
actual 50 Nations it comes out to 40 of the 50 nations are 
Muslim-nations okay um so clearly in as much as this is an 
important and pressing topic-it's and it is global 
obviously but there is definitely a particular 
actor-involved in the persecution of Christians around the 
world which I-would call Islam because most of this 80% of 
it is happening in Islamic-countries all right and then 
when you think of countries like so a lot of-people will 
complain and tell me Well North Korea is worse and it is 
North-Korea if you're found as a Christian you're done okay 
that's why it's number-one worst country but the good news 
about that is there's a light under the-tunnel because 
North Korea is just it's a it's a cultic kind of you 
know-dictatorship and this charismatic guy if you want to 
call him charismatic-whatever I mean some people call him 
that but it's a cult and you know he's-responsible for it 
it's a top down persecution but Korea because 
there's-nothing um ingrained to it it's just him it's a 
temporal Thing Once he's gone-North Korea could just be 
like South Korea which is actually a very vibrant-Christian 
Nation so it's not um an existential aspect when you look 
at-certain other countries like North Korea okay the 
problem is in Islam and we'll-talk about about that it is 
existential and this is why Arab countries 
African-countries Indonesian East Asian Pakistan Iran these 
countries don't have a lot in-common you know culturally 
racially socioeconomically but they have Islam in-common 
and so it's very telling that you will see the same 
patterns of-persecution arise in all of those countries and 
even though they're so-different but what makes it worse 
and going back to the North Korean example-example there is 
no light under the tunnel for these countries because 
the-reason all of them are so different and at the same 
time doing the same thing is-because it comes down to one 
word Islam they are Islamic countries and the-persecution 
dislike hostility for Christians and others is just in 
emical-to the religion itself okay and I don't want to 
spend too much time trying to-explain that I think this 
particular audience understands it um you know but-brief y 
Islam's doctrines are so hostile to the non-muslims they're 
very divisive-okay and as I've explained before the genius 
if you will of Muhammad is that-he took his tribalistic 
Society of 7th Century Arabia and he rearticulated it-in 
it's still tribal but through deistic terms so now it's not 
one Arab tribe-against another it's the Muslim tribe the 
umah against the world because-they're all the bad tribe 
and so the same thing that the Arabs would do to um-other 
tribes which is in in that mentality in that culture 7th 
Century-Arabia if you're not part of my tribe you are free 
Gain I can kill you rape-you enslave you plunder you that's 
it that's the society so I think Islam took-that but it 
changed it it's not it's not you know this tribe or that 
it's the-Muslims against the cfers the infidels which is 
everyone else so and there's so-so many verses I can get 
into you know like uh and people don't know this I-mean 
they think they think the concept of jihad is in the Quran 
and it is but-it's really worse than that to me the more 
telling quranic verses are the ones-that Don't Preach Jihad 
but preach hatred okay so in the Quran it literally-says to 
Muslims you must hate non-muslims you must have enmity in 
your-heart for them all right and it has a whole you know a 
whole categories of how-to do that and so for example in 
Islam it's okay-for a Muslim to marry what's called a woman 
of the book meaning a Christian or-a Jew and often in 
politically correct-circles this is presented as a form of 
Tolerance but that same Muslim is is-According to Islamic 
teaching and I've seen so many writings and videos 
by-Muslims saying this he has to hate her because she's an 
Infidel and according-to these divisive doctrines that I 
mentioned he must hate her and he must-show her he hates 
her in the hope that she converts but he can enjoy 
her-sexually and treat her as his wife otherwise okay 
because that's also-convenient so that's and also the Quran 
talks about um you know it Praises those-Muslims who killed 
their fathers their mothers their siblings their 
children-their wives because they were not Muslims during 
the time of Muhammad okay-so it's so divisive that you know 
if you're not a Muslim you are the enemy to-be treated with 
according and again there's a whole bunch of-categories on 
how to do that including here in the west because it's not 
a it's-not a stupid Doctrine and there's a lot of caveats 
that help enable it um-including deception okay um so that 
was just a brief kind of little doctrinal-interlude to 
explain why it is that Christians are being attacked the 
Quran-calls on calls Christians infidels okay because they 
believe in the Trinity and-it says that the people the the 
Christians who believe believe in the-Trinity are infidels 
Infidel is an English word that I use and it's 
not-necessarily a good translation of the word kaffer the 
word kefer basically in-Islamic Juris Prudence means your 
blood is free game okay if you're a Jew or a-Christian or 
any non-muslim you can be killed at will at-sight done okay 
subjugated whatever and and the authorities are with you 
and a-lot of this of course I'm giving you is is historical 
but as you can see and can-imagine it's still impacts 
modern day Muslims because they read these texts-even 
though you don't because they're intentionally hidden from 
you okay so-that that's that I just want to give you a 
little quick doctrinal because someone-may may be thinking 
why this hatred for Christianity all right and I gave 
you-all these statistics so let's take a a real quick case 
study about the deaths-and the murders and all that so 
Nigeria in my opinion as someone who's been-following 
what's happening Nigeria today is the absolute worst war 
zone for-Christians it's m Nigeria is about half Muslim 
half Christian most of the-Muslims are con concentrated in 
the north and most of the Christians are in-the South but 
it is and according to numerous um human rights 
organizations-neutral ones it's a genocide what's happening 
right now there's a genocide-that's been going on before 
Ukraine okay and it's been going on for years and 
the-numbers uh okay I'm looking at some numbers right here 
so just between-2009 and uh 2021 it's been much worse since 
2021 in the last 2 years but just-uh between those 12 or so 
years 70,000 Christians were B-butchered because of their 
religion by Muslims in Nigeria and 20,000 churches-were 
burned destroyed and turned into mosques I mean just 
imagine for a moment-if this was the opposite if this was 
Christians doing this to Muslims do you-think you might 
have heard of it you think it would be in the news all 
right-so that's uh that's one example now the other thing 
for me that I think also-really uh uh solidifies the idea 
that this is an Islamic issue is the patterns-so for I I 
told you for since whatever 2009 I've been really closely 
following-and documenting the persecution of Christians in 
their Muslim countries and-what amazes me is certain 
patterns always emerge it and it doesn't matter-the country 
again we're talking about remember when you talking about 
the-Muslim world you're talking about different races and 
economics and-societies and cultures you're talking about 
Persia Iran turkey and then you're-talking about the Arab 
world you're talking about Indonesia Malaysia 
you're-talking about uh subsaharan Africa again but what 
you find interesting is the-same patterns emerge in the 
persecution of all these different societies and why-is 
that because if you read about it and you look into it it 
actually goes back-to Islamic law Sharia okay so one main 
example is churches-there's an attack on churches all 
throughout the Islamic World sometimes-it's from the 
authorities all right Saudi Arabia if-you're in Saudi 
Arabia our good friends and allies you cannot have a church 
in-there and there's a feta out there that says if there's 
a church or even some-Christians workers Filipinos sit in 
the house and try to celebrate Christmas-they get arrested 
and tortured okay that's our good friends and allies 
in-Saudi Arab I but then there's the terrorists and they'll 
take it a step-further they'll go bomb it and blow it up 
and we've seen that countless times-not just with Isis the 
Islamic State but so many other groups that their 
names-morph and change but what they are is Islamic 
terrorists okay and that's-happened a lot in Egypt in Syria 
in Nigeria all throughout Iraq constantly-Russia I mean 
even countries you wouldn't think about also there's 
this-uh what I call like a trifect attack on Christian 
freedom and this goes back to-Islam if you're a Christian 
and you want to if you're a Muslim and you want to-become a 
Christian you're an apostate you're done this goes on 
constantly in-these reports that I look at uh you're 
attacked you're killed you're impr-prisoned you're beat up 
you're ostracized from your family if you're a-woman they 
take your children away right a blasphemer so a Christian 
blasphemer-is basically not here in Denmark you think a 
Christian blasphemer is a guy-who burns the Quran but in 
the Muslim world the Christian Blas is a-blasphemers who 
says something like Christ is the Son of God or Christ 
was-resurrected why because you are contradicting the Quran 
and therefore-you're calling Muhammad a liar so you're a 
blasphemer and you get attacked and-you get killed and this 
happens so many times especially in countries like-Pakistan 
where they have these really Draconian laws same thing 
for-evangelists if you're a Christian preacher okay whether 
you're indigenous-or western or whatever and you're in the 
Islamic world you will get attacked you-go to prison you 
get get killed okay because you're the one who's 
creating-the apostates so there's a a lot of tremendous 
pressure now these three-things apostates blasphemers and 
evangelists this is all written out in-Islamic Sharia law 
the khif Omar who created this pact with the 
first-Christian so-called themi community in Jerusalem 
after Jerusalem was conquered-in around 637 made them agree 
to all these stipulations we we're not going to-build 
churches we're not going to renovate Church churches we're 
not going-to show our crosses we're not going to say 
anything against Muhammad we're not-going to preach so this 
is actually part of the religion and then other patterns-of 
course come in which is one one of the more popular ones 
that you probably-don't hear about is the sexual abuse rape 
and forc conversion of Christian-women that is again very 
endemic to the Islamic World wherever there are-Christian 
minorities and other minorities as well but as I'll explain 
a-bit there's a reason there's more Christians in these 
regions uh than-elsewhere so when I um and I learned all 
this uh when I started that the um I-mentioned I've been 
running a report since-2011 that I told you I thought well 
maybe a month will come there'll nothing-be there no there 
was always something there but all these um patterns 
emerged-and to me it was very telling that every single one 
of these patterns had an-Islamic imperative traced back to 
it it was there in their books and they knew-it and if you 
can read Arabic and watch your videos like I can do when 
these-attacks happen that's how they justify it they quote 
the Quran they quote the-Hadith you know Muhammad's uh 
words and sayings so it's always there the uh the-hostility 
towards Christianity um maybe a couple of words about 
history so how-did all this happen you know until today 
with my joke about Coptic being a you-know police officer 
so many people I think in the west are completely-oblivious 
to the historical origin of the Middle East and the Islamic 
world-World okay when you talk about the Muslim world and 
if I talk about this-topic and I say Christians are being 
persecuted etc etc you know what I'm-often told well I get 
it I feel bad for them but why are they going there in 
the-first place why are they going to the Muslim-World well 
it's because they were there centuries before the Muslims 
came so-here's a little bit of the hidden hidden history um 
in the sth century when Islam-you know splashed onto the 
world scene um if you talked about the Christian-world and 
you definitely had a Christian world this is s centuries 
after Christ-and you looked at the map most of it the heart 
of it the more sophisticated-intellectual and richer part 
was the east or what we would call North Africa-from 
Morocco to Egypt and all of um the Middle East Syria 
greater Syria which-encompassed uh what we would call today 
Israel Lebanon um and all that it was-greater Syria and 
Iraq and of course well what we call Turkey Asia Minor 
that-was Christianity and then you had an outpost in Rome 
okay which was also of-course significant and you had five 
Seas one of them was Rome the other four were-in the East 
Alexandria Antioch Jerusalem and-Constantinople in just one 
or two centuries the first century Islamic-conquests 
completely swallowed up that whole area the older richer 
original-Christian region which is North Africa I mean 
think of people like uh you know-Augustine of Hippo I mean 
he's a North African and if you think of the Nan-Creed and 
all the uh the Aryan controversy all these guys were 
actually-Copic Egyptians athanasius was Egyptian even the 
Aryan heretic was an Egyptian-um so you had a lot of heavy 
Christian influence from that area that people-don't 
remember they think Christianity is something that just 
happened in-Europe with Rome Etc later on Protestant 
Reformation but actually this is why-Constantine went from 
Rome he actually moved the capital to the east to 
new-Constantinople or New Rome his named after 
him-Constantinople um so this kind of History I think is 
very important to-understand what actually happened Muslims 
conquered it Peace by piece um-and I discuss it in one of 
my books that's it's dedicated to show you how-Century 
after Century battle after battle you had a very hardcore 
Christian-region slowly turned into Islam and then the 
Christian minorities the remnants-had to do as best as they 
could they became What's called the okay which is-like a 
According to Islamic law like a second class or third class 
citizen who-has to pay tribute and then live according to 
all these strictures don't-build churches don't renovate 
churches hide your crosses don't talk about-religion don't 
offend the Muslim it even has laws like get off your if 
you're in-a basically like the Rosa Park American thing you 
know if a Muslim wants your-seat give him your seat so 
that's how it was for centuries and now uh and then-the 
even Europe okay so after all of North Africa and the 
Middle East was-conquered in 711 this is not even a century 
after-Muhammad died you had Islam in Spain conquering it 
Islam conquered Spain in-the year 7-Eleven and then 20 
years later 732 it's in the heart of Europe at-the Battle 
of Tours Charles Martell you're familiar with that so 
before that-you saw like dominoes all these ancient 
Christian regions being conquered and-being subjugated and 
all of the stuff that we're talking about now that seems-to 
be some sort of modern aberration started then so that's 
why for me when I-talk about Christian persecution today 
it's it's a continuity this isn't new-this is just the 
continuation of a very old story that has been shielded 
from-you because you you know Islam is a religion of peace 
and tolerance so-obviously whatever is happening now is not 
representative of Islam it's just a-it's a minority 
extremist kind of thing so the story goes um and you know 
we-have to talk about the Crusades if you want to talk 
about the-misrepresentations of you know how people 
understand things so Islam from-the year 636 to I mentioned 
10:32 I mentioned uh 732 the Battle of-Tours but then all 
the way there's so many more battles I discuss and by 
1070-okay Islam now has conquered Asia Minor this is one of 
the oldest Christian-regions most of St Paul's letters are 
to Asia Minor because that's how Christian-it was now it's 
turkey we call it okay but at that point this is right 
before-the Crusades they were almost near Constantinople 
and the Eastern Emperor-called for Aid and the Christians 
saw what was happening to the Armenians and-the Greek 
Christians in Anatolia and the sources are horrific tens 
and thousands-of Christians being massacred butchered 
enslaved churches burning in one city-one Armenian City Ani 
1,000 churches were burned intentionally it was so you-know 
when you hear about Isis the Islamic State it was that on 
steroids-but it was actually not a bunch of terrorists it 
was the caliphate it was a-sultanate it was the 
representatives of Islam who were talking this way and 
who-were acting this way and that's the origins of the 
First Crusade which I-find very interesting because the 
first Crusaders learned what was happening to-the 
Christians of the East as well as to the church in the Holy 
Land the Church-of the Holy sepulture which was of course 
important to them and that's why-they went there it was 
actually a heroic stance against aggression and 
it-completely accorded with what Christian teaching says is 
just War Theory okay-we're liberating we're defending it's 
not aggression this is originally-Christian territory 
before it became Muslim so we're going there uh to wage-uh 
Crusade and it was of course for centuries seen as one of 
the most noble-altruistic Christian things today of course 
it's the most demonic thing and-Christians are still being 
pounded on the head about the Crusade why because-the whole 
story has been completely subverted and um I I've read so 
many-historians and I can name them and I know them you 
might know them you might-not know these names but they're 
very big in America people like John espito-Karen Armstrong 
who purport to be historians they will present 
Islam-spreading peacefully for the first few centuries and 
everything was fine and-then in the year 1095 these evil 
Catholics decided to go and just create-war and Havoc so 
it's presented in a vacuum as usual and this is 
something-that happens today in politics when we talk about 
modern day instances and-events they're presented in a 
vacuum you're not told that Muslims were-massacring killing 
torturing raping burning churches one khif before the 
uh-before the Crusades burned 30,000 churches in Syria and 
Egypt alone okay I-mean so the problem with so many of the 
lies today is not that they are not-telling you the truth 
it's they're withholding the background so they tell-you 
the truth yeah these Crusaders went fought and killed 
sounds kind of bad but-they're not telling you what the 
Muslims were doing to provoke all this anger-righteous 
anger I would argue um so to me this is another that's why 
I've very-much gravitated towards the historical aspect not 
just because there's such an-evident continuity between 
what Muslims have been doing to Christians-but because it 
really makes sense of why Islam is the way it is today 
because it-hasn't changed okay but when they put it in your 
head that Islam if you go to any-college or watch a 
documentary Islam is peace and the only time you 
have-barbarians it's in the Middle Ages when you get the 
Crusaders and then they ruin-it and they you know alienate 
Muslims who are hither to tolerant and-open-minded that's 
all lies that's just completely fabricated and it's meant 
to-demonize honestly the the Christians um as opposed to 
the Muslims-and you know to stick one one more point about 
the Crusades everyone here has-heard of the Crusades right 
whether you like him or dislike him you've heard of-them 
but the fact is if you stand back from a macrohistorical 
point of view and-you look at all the wars and conflicts 
and antagonism between Christians and-Muslims the Crusades 
are a drop in the bucket very insignificant you don't 
hear-about the Muslim attacks that swallow up vast portions 
as I told you of North-Africa in the Middle East or how 
they swallowed up Asia Minor how they-conquered 
Constantinople Spain was conquered and it took them 800 
years of-warfare okay people don't know that Muslims went 
as far as Iceland in the-16th century to get slaves okay 
and Denmark actually and England they had a-I think it's 
called lundi a little island off the coast of England 
where-they raided the English Coast for slaves and then you 
can you look in the East-same thing with the with the 
Ottomans I remember reading in their documents 
and-Chronicles every year they'd come back with 50 100,000 
hungarians or or any or-Slavs in general which is where we 
get the word slav or slaves then there's a-Russians and and 
that's completely been sidestepped because Russians are not 
hip-anymore but they're part of this long story too you 
probably heard of the-Mongol yoke or the Tatar yoke uh 
where the where the Russians were actually-conquered by the 
Mongols what you don't hear is they actually were converts 
to-Islam the tatars as are known and they also brought in 
the whole panoply of-Islamic law discrimination hostility 
and the Russians were living under that for-centuries so if 
you actually look in these Russian Chronicles they're 
not-fighting against Mongols they're fighting against 
Muslims okay so this-was a really um multi- tentacled Jihad 
if you will on every corner of America-even the United 
States of America not not America of the world even the 
United-States of America few people know this it's 
first-war as a nation so of course it had the revolutionary 
war with Britain after it-gained independence maybe 10 
years later it actually was drawn into another first-war as 
a nation with Muslims the so-called barbery Pirates of 
North-Africa because it was their job to uh enslave 
Christian vessels that they-would find and and take the 
Christians and plunder them etc etc and none other-than 
Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Congress it's dated I 
have it in one of-my books like 1796 and he talks about how 
he met the-Muslim ambassador from barbar and said why are 
you doing this we want to make-peace don't attack our 
vessels and the and and he and then he-quotes what the the 
the barbery Ambassador said and the quote is like-reading 
Isis talking to us the Quran says you're an Infidel you're 
our enemy-me it's our duty based on the Quran on our 
Prophet to attack you plunder you-kill you make subjects of 
you and slaves and destroy your churches etc etc so you-can 
only imagine what Mr Thomas Jefferson thought because he's 
the-Paragon of the Enlightenment after he heard that kind 
of logic okay but so the-point is to show you this has been 
going on for so long that I always find it-mindboggling to 
have someone come and tell me oh no Islam means peace and 
the-radical thing that's something new that just happened 
no it didn't and so you-know to move back to the Christian 
modern modern Christian era to me it's-just a continuity 
there's no difference because the same stuff that 
happened-then they were destroying churches in in Christian 
regions as I told you one khif-30,000 churches that's 
according to Muslim sources okay this is an-exaggeration 
that's what they say and this was seen as a work of piety 
so it's-little wonder that the remnants of Christians 
whether cops in Egypt or-Assyrians in Iraq in Syria or 
Armenians if you know what's happening with aeran-and 
Armenia there's another genocide going on which is entirely 
based again-on religion though no media will tell you that 
it's just a territorial dispute-okay but if you dig deep 
downside you're going to find it's the same exact-dynamic 
the first thing these azerb Janis do is they go and Destroy 
churches-break the crosses and turn it into a mosque okay 
they go to um Christian-cemeteries and Destroy and 
pulverize the process because they don't want to see-it and 
they want to claim it's our land and we're never Christians 
here in the-first place so it's sad on the one hand that 
this is a very long history which-has been suppressed and 
therefore we don't understand current events so when-you 
see Christians being persecuted uh one of the reasons or 
one of the excuses-a thinking talking head today will say 
oh it's because of this it's because of-grievances or it's 
a it's a territorial dispute no dig deep down inside 
it's-always the old ancient religious hostility uh for 
Christians now it's-actually getting much worse um hither 
to what I've said I'm sure I'm talking-about Islam you're 
thinking this is an Islam problem and it is I told you 
80%-of the 50 Nations and so forth are Muslim but it's 
actually now that I'm-still following it's getting much 
worse and it's spreading into other nations so-now India is 
actually the ninth or 10th worst nation in the world where 
there's-it's almost the same same sort of persecution that 
Christians experience-in the Muslim world in the worst 
Muslim worlds and I saw really graphic videos-recently and 
the things that are happening and the same logic you may 
say-Well they're not Muslims so what is it and I think 
what's happening now and-it's not just India I mentioned 
Nicaragua I mentioned South American-countries which are 
traditionally Catholic and we're going to talk a-little bit 
about Europe but I think it's just ultimately a hostility 
towards-Christianity and it whatever excuse is needed is 
going to be the excuse-that's implemented for Muslims it's 
the Sharia thing amongst Indians it's a-nationalism thing 
you can't be a true Indian if you're a Christian so 
then-they persecute ostracize you and it's going on now in 
all these countries so I-really think it's it's it's bad 
enough the way it was with just Muslims but-it's becoming 
more and more of a global attack on Christians including 
here in-the west even if it's considered minor people here 
or at least in America they-talk about the war on Christmas 
okay so if you're a Christian you can't say-Merry Christmas 
you say have you have to say happy holidays you can't um 
you know-you can't really emphasize the Christian nature 
of-Christmas okay I'm sure it's the same here in Europe so 
as you can see it's-not just the Muslims but there's other 
factors and forces involved and they're-really all working 
in concert for the same end and it's sad to see so 
many-Christians are completely oblivious to this-um so one 
of the questions is well what about the media and the 
journalists-because they're objective and they should at 
least report the truth with-what's going on after all what 
I've said sounds dramatic I mean surely this is a-news 
story should be on a some report so how how to explain it 
well-there's a lot of ways to explain it um the first I 
actually think it's or one-of the more obvious ones it's 
unfashionable I think Western peoples-European peoples 
especially Christian they're very happy to show 
their-altruistic love for others and help but not those 
Christians because that almost-looks tribal we're picking 
the same guys that we are it's much more fashionable-to 
support Buddhists or you know Indians and uh or or Muslims 
the rohinga and you-know Burma and what's happening but to 
help Christians is almost like you're-helping my kind of 
guy and I want to show you I'm actually open-minded I'm-I'm 
I'm I'm not helping I'm not tribal I'm helping in other 
people of their-religion so I think there's that stigma 
that ironically because Christians are-what so many people 
in the west are they're the least helped because you-don't 
want to help them you want to help something a little more 
that shows you-as more openminded more tolerant as as 
opposed to being um uh tribalistic I-suppose in this sense 
um then there's the hypocrisy and-I and I'll just show you 
I'll give you one example of how bad the hypoc y gets-um so 
March 15th has been dugged if you don't know this as Islam 
combat-islamophobia day international by the UN and 
other-governing bodies so on every March 15th we all must 
acknowledge recognize and-seek to combat islamophobia and 
why was that date-picked because on March 15th I forget 2 3 
years ago 3 four years ago-um in New Zealand I suppose some 
Australian guy walked into uh a church-oh no a mosque and 
killed 51 Muslims I'm sure you all heard of it how could 
you-not okay Church yeah Christ Church in New Zealand 51 
Muslims were killed so-that was enough for the UN to 
declare International Day to combat islamophobia-on the 
date of that Massacre now it just so happens because I 
track type of thing-that I did a I I did a a little 
research and I came that in that same time frame-roughly 
there were about a 100 attacks by Muslims on Christian 
churches not in-one country but the Middle East North 
Africa Pakistan Indonesia turkey Iran-everywhere okay and 
of course the main culprits Egypt Iraq and 
subsaharan-Africa there were about I wrote I I I documented 
it collated something like 20-attacks of Muslims attacking 
churches and they killed over a thousand-Christians all 
right just in those attacks but there's no 
combat-International Christian phobia day for some reason 
okay but one attack where-you had 50 Muslims get killed was 
enough for the whole world to stand up and-create a whole 
new day all right but when you got a thousand people 
killed-and in this case the parallels are even worse 
because you can say that the guy-um the guy who the 
Australian guy who did the Christ Church New Zealand 
thing-is an aberration how often does that happen it's not 
like a daily thing where-some western guy goes and kills 
Muslims but they made it into a pattern but-where there is 
a pattern where you have Muslims in numerous countries 
under the-same logic quoting the same quranic verses 
bombing churches and killing-Christians that is dismissed 
as well it's just a product of terrorism it's-just a 
product of whatever it's not anything against Christians 
they won't-even name the word Christian I don't know if you 
remember this but one of the-worst Muslim attacks on 
Christians back when Obama was President um he would 
not-even say Christians were killed he said Easter 
worshippers were attacked and-killed okay so to just kind 
of again sideline who's being killed and who's-the killer 
okay so this is obviously a big issue and you-know the 
latest one that I've the excuses that they come up with 
to-rationalize why Muslims kill Christians which they won't 
even say that much is-grievances okay Muslims have 
Grievances and I'm sure you're familiar with this-Muslims 
are angry and therefore they lash out and kill which is 
your fault-because you made them angry okay so that's 
that's that's the standard-explanation but then you have 
the most recent one I've seen and show you how-ludicrous 
they are but also how clever they are because they're 
trying to kill-two birds with one stone that is to you know 
push two of their agendas the new-reason that in Nigeria 
5,000 or 4,000 Christians get killed every year and 
I-quoted to you the number 60,000 in about 10 or 12 years 
is because of wait for a-climate change okay so it has 
nothing to do with the religion it's just it just-so 
happens that the Muslims are killing the Christians but 
it's because climate-change is pushing them and they have 
nowhere to graze their livestock so so-they go and dress in 
black and scream Allah abbar and cut Christian heads 
off-it's climate change so there's definitely a uh a very 
big agenda and-there's so many other examples another one 
that just popped in my head is um-one of the most 
sensationalist Islamic Terror attacks on Christians-was if 
you recall I think it was in 2015 when the Islamic State 
videotaped-themselves butchering 21 Coptic Christians in 
Libya remember the orange-jumpsuits and I've I actually 
because it's my job I have to watch these videos-and 
they're really off-putting but I have to watch the details 
as they Cho-their heads off which is very real and that 
actually got some coverage in the-western media of course 
it was presented as an aberration these guys are 
not-Muslims or terrorists and then even attack these guys 
aren't even Christians-they were Egyptians okay um but that 
story someone wrote a very interesting-article in they 
document that it got eight times less media coverage than 
the-killing of a gorilla in America so a gorilla was killed 
you may-remember this CU it was a big story so they had to 
put down a gorilla because-some child fell in the zoo or 
whatever that received eight times more coverage-than 21 
Christians literally having their head chopped off because 
they-would not recant Christ okay and again I ask you 
imagine if this was Christians-doing that to Muslims do you 
think that would have gotten some coverage you-think you 
would have heard about it okay so clearly there is a major 
agenda um-and maybe maybe it's good to kind of wrap it off 
here bring it home make it-personal because I understand 
you have very large Muslim-populations and and I'm not you 
know when I talk-about this topic I don't talk about 
Muslims because I'm not I don't know-what's in the mind and 
the Heart of a person okay I mean someone can tell me-he's 
a Christian but he's not someone can be that kind of 
Christian so when I-hear someone's Muslim I don't know but 
what I do know is that Islam is-fundamentally inherently 
tribal and divisive and hostile that's the religion-now 
maybe there's Muslims who don't believe in that and they 
don't-incorporate it in their lives and maybe they do 
assimilate I I have no problem-with that but I know there's 
a lot of the other guys okay who do think this-way and it's 
definitely happening here in Europe so maybe you're 
familiar with-this website called uh The Observatory of 
Christian-phobia it's actually a European website-anyway I 
follow it and every single day there's like two or three 
stories of-churches in Europe being attacked vandalized 
crosses being broken-okay cemeteries being desecrated 
crosses being broken etc-etc but nobody knows could be 
doing this um but to me because I know what happens-in the 
Middle East and the Muslim world this is common in the 
Muslim world it's-very it's very common for Muslims to 
desecrate Christian cemeteries break-crosses attack and 
burn churches and in France it's so-bad I did some research 
and I wrote an article a few years ago but apparently-in 
France every day two churches are attacked in very graphic 
ways like feces-smear uh you know Mary statue or Christ 
statue-decapitated churches broken and finally it got so 
bad at one-point that some U American big mainstream media 
wrote a report about it-and I read it and you know they got 
the fact straight that there's attacks on-churches etc etc 
but when it came to who I went up and down I didn't see the 
word-Muslim I didn't see the world migrant I didn't see the 
word islamist and in the-end it said the main culprits 
appeared to be feminists who are angry at the-patriarchy 
okay so there's a lot of lot of work-there's a lot of 
effort to conceal what's happening here which is just an 
a-reflection a small reflection for now of what happens 
there okay where Muslims-are in strength Christianity is 
completely obliterated abused churches-Etc now I look and 
it's ironically when I look at Europe the one the 
countries-that are most attacked in this sense ironically 
have a large Muslim-population they're France Germany 
Sweden um Denmark too I mean you're not-as bad obviously as 
these big big countries that have big Muslim-populations 
but you see it too and it's again the same pattern to me 
patterns-are very U are very revealing of who's behind this 
and what's going on these-are all the patterns I see where 
Muslims are attacking Christians in where it-where they're 
the majority the Middle East Muslims um so it's not 
surprising-to wonder or to think who's doing especially 
when the worst countries have-the largest Muslim 
populations okay so it's definitely spilling into here 
it's-coming into here more so into some countries in others 
clearly uh but it's-definitely it's and there's so much 
naivity because the history I just told-you the doctrines I 
just told you and the statistics I just told you are 
all-anema these are not things that anyone's going to be 
talking about in your Prime-Time news because they have a 
narrative and what I'm talking about is a wrench-in that 
narrative and they're never going to do that so um I think 
that's-the uh current state of affairs and I will end it 
there and take a break and-have questions thank-you
