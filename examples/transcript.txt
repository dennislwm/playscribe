you can actually gain muscle on8 grams of protein maybe you 
can gain more-muscle on 1.2 but you can still gain muscle 
on the8 gram protein per kilogram-body mass per day the 
body is much smarter than we think the question I was-are 
being asked the most is do I need to take the protein 
before or after the-exercise session which is almost the 
same question you asking should I do the-exercise before 
the meal or after the meal it's basically Al also the 
same-thing it doesn't really matter that much because 
exercise makes the muscle more-sensitive to the stimulation 
of muscle protein synthesis through food intake-but it does 
so for up to 24 to even 48 hours so much of the 
responsiveness the-anabolic resistance can be overcome by 
physical activity so my question is to-what extent is 
anabolic resistance not for the greatest amount simply uh 
uh-secondary to a lower physical activity level I'm 
delighted to be sitting here-with Luke vanloon who is a 
professor at mastrick University in Netherlands he is-well 
known for his significant contributions in the field of 
exercise-and nutrition um particularly looking at how 
protein metabolism affects muscle-adaptations how exercise 
affects protein turnover I'm very excited to have 
a-discussion with you today Luke um maybe we could start at 
the-beginning why protein is important why we need protein 
so it's interesting to-realize that all tissues all living 
tissues so also scal muscle tissue is-constant conly being 
synthesized and broken down and that is always hard 
to-imagine that every tissue in your body is breaking down 
building up again so-all the constituents are constantly 
being renewed remobilized re refurnished-and so for muscle 
that happens at a rate of 1 to 2% per day which means that 
in-say 50 to 100 days you have completely renewed your 
muscle and so that renewal-is actually one of the factors 
that makes it able to adapt to to its use to-become bigger 
if you become a bodybuilder or become smaller when 
you-actually don't move around anymore so that Dynamic that 
is that is why we uh-yeah that is what tissue is and that 
tissue requires constant renewal and-therefore it needs 
protein or at least the building blocks of proteins 
being-the amino acids so there's protein requirements that 
have been established-by a variety of committees World 
Health Organization um and those protein-requirements are 
generally 0.8 gram of protein per kilogram body weight can 
you-tell people what evidence that you know those 
requirements were established on-or how that was based 
where it came from yeah that's uh that's always that 
that-is a lecture on itself um so in the past um people did 
a lot of nitrogen balance-studies so Amino AIDS contain 
nitrogen and so nitrogen goes into the body as as-protein 
and nitrogen also leaves the body as nitrogen but then as 
Ura or in-in in in the urine and so measuring the balance 
between what goes into the body-and what leaves the body 
gives a nice way of seeing whether you're in a-positive 
balance a negative balance or a neutral balance so what 
they've done in-the past is basically give people a low 
protein content diet for one or two-weeks uh a moderate or 
a high amount of protein and then see whether you become-in 
a positive or negative balance and the assumption is if 
you're in a neutral-balance it's good and if you actually 
give a low protein diet you go down to-66 then you actually 
can stay in most people actually stay in a neutral-balance 
and then they suggested with some leverage on top we 
actually get to-the8 gam but that is I regard that as 
a-minimal requirement to stay in balance on the diet that 
has been provided for 1-to two weeks and that's a little 
bit an issue because first of all some-metalogical issues 
with nitrogen balance it's difficult to really figure out 
how-much nitrogen goes in because people always under 
report what they're eating-and the second part is there's 
also some nitrogen leaving the body that you don't-measure 
for example in in air or you f the skin so that's already 
an issue but-the other thing is the body can adapt to more 
or less-protein so being in a certain balance doesn't 
guarantee that that is actually-your requirement or your 
optimal requirement and that's where all the the-discussion 
comes from because as I said if you have your muscle 
turning over and-you give it less protein the turnover will 
actually go down is that a good-thing is that a bad thing 
if you have a house and you want-to renew it do you want to 
change a lot of things or do you want to stay and not-do 
anything uh another uh you can compare-with getting money 
if I give you less money you'll probably buy Less Foods 
or-cheaper food or you go for the discounted Foods if I 
give you more-money you probably buy the more expensive 
foods but you still get the-same need you f fulfill the 
same needs if that makes any sense so turnover 
and-requirement we don't know how that varies I mean people 
can adapt to a-higher protein intake diet people can adapt 
to a low protein intake diet so-you said people in this in 
the studies that were that were used um to determine-the 
the you know requirement or being a neutral at least being 
in the neutral-balance um were these people older younger 
were they mostly sedentary-physically active or is any of 
that you know was what what's known and what's-not known 
for those studies in in those years those were most of all 
uh healthy-people there's only a few studies that actually 
had older really older people-in there um and most of them 
were relatively healthy and lean um so yes-there might be 
differences whether you become more obese you're more 
active-you're older or younger you're male you're female so 
those may all um change-the requirements but I think one of 
the things that we always lose um-perspective of is what is 
requirement what is required for Optimal-Health and that's 
of course depends on what you're used to I am I mean 
there's-no studies that have done that as far as I know but 
if you actually have a-protein in lower than 8 would you 
disappear I don't think so there's-people that actually 
survive on much lesser protein and so they can regain 
a-certain balance but also people that overc-consumed 
protein can regain a balance so the body adapts if we 
weren't able to-adapt we wouldn't be alive today today so 
how is that that people that are-consuming really low 
protein diets I I personally um don't subscribe to 
that-type of diet myself but there are many people as you 
said that do consume low-protein diets whether it's by 
choice or not but you're you're right they don't-they don't 
disappear um I mean when you get to the extreme level they 
look like-they lost a lot of muscle but um is there some 
sort of adaptation in other-organs that change the way 
protein is distributed or absorbed very very good-question 
so when I start talking about something-it's almost a 99.9 
9% it's about muscle and also a lot of your viewers 
will-discuss muscle but of course the body consists of all 
these different tissues-and if I tell somebody that his arm 
or his muscle is actually reconditioned-completely in in 
two to three months people are amazed but then if you 
start-looking at all the other tissues you'll get even more 
amazed and so we started-doing that looking at turnover of 
other organs now you can't stick a needle uh-in in the 
liver and in the pancreas and in the brain just like we do 
in muscle-in order to measure turnover but we actually do 
this prior to surgery so-over the last few years we've 
actually put tracers stabil isotope labeled amino-acid 
tracers in the body and then measured the turnover rate of 
all the-other tissues prior to surgery and then during 
surgery the tissue comes out and-then we were happy to take 
some of that tissue to measure the the turnover rate-now 
Translating that more and popular scientific you have a new 
liver in the-week you have a new intestine in two days you 
have a new brain in 3 weeks-brain turnover brain protein 
turnover is about three times as fast as muscle so-all of 
these tissues are constantly breaking down and building up 
breaking-up so every constituent all the amino acids are 
constant constantly being-changed I used to tell that 
muscle is the most important organ and responsible-for most 
of the protein metabolism simply because you have about 
30-kilograms of of muscle in your body but the turnover 
rates of all your other-organs is much higher so actually 
on a whole body level I think muscle isn't-isn't that 
important for total so in a total body we synthesize on a 
daily-basis about 300 gram of protein and how much do you 
eat about 70-gram so that means that we're go that we're 
recycling 230 gram of amino acids-on a daily basis so 
realize constantly one amino-acids is being released from a 
protein in your brain it gets back into your-circulation 
it's being actually used to synthesize your left to your 
right toe-and that is constantly happening everywhere and 
so it's amazing that we-you reuse all these amino acids in 
the body and then we renew them refresh them-with only 70 
gram and that's why we need protein now if you refresh with 
less-proteins probably as you suggest turnover rates of 
some of the other-organs might go down which ones we don't 
know we know lot about muscle we hardly-know anybody 
anything about all who how the other organs respond to 
protein-intake so there's a lot to learn okay um what about 
people that are you know-engaged in resistance training so 
you are you are you know putting a a stress-on your muscle 
and you know obviously there's going to probably increase 
the-turnover as well so you that do the how how much do the 
demands in terms of-protein requirements go up now I know 
it probably depends a lot on what your-goals are are your 
goals to be an elite bodybuilder or are your goals to 
uh-Stave off muscle atrophy but it'd be nice to have you 
know what are some of-the requirements for protein intake 
with people that are engaged in frequent-resistance 
training also some aerobic conditioning not Elite athletes 
just-just regular people that are committed to health and 
also-hear a lot in the in the bodybuilding community that 
you should just eat one-gram of protein per pound which is 
2.2 grams per kilogram body weight I'd love-to know what 
your thoughts are on that as well lot of questions there so 
first-thing is um protein synthesis is not the same as 
muscle protein accretion so the-building of muscle is not 
the same as reconditioning when people like Stu-Phillips 
myself we measure muscle dri protein synthesis now the 
muscle protein-synthesis goes up after exercise when you do 
endurance type exercise but also-when you do resistance 
type exercise the long-term adaptation of course 
is-completely different look at the physique of a marathon 
runner and a-bodybuilder they're hugely different but they 
both have very high muscle protein-synthesis after a 
training session so the protein synthesis is a meas of 
to-what extent does the muscle recondition to become more 
adapted to the type of-exercise that you perform now we do 
see that if you ingest more proteins uh-above .8 and 
towards say 1.6 1 Point even some people suggest 1.8 that 
you-get a more efficient reconditioning now does the muscle 
need-all that protein no because for example in the 
endurance atlete the endurance-atlete is not gaining weight 
at least I hope not because that wouldn't be good-for him 
but he actually is renewing that muscle much faster and 
that requires-fresh proteins coming in now what I said the 
optimal requirements we don't know-but we do know is that 
at least for muscle mass gain so for the resistance-type 
guys that want to gain more muscle that it tends to have 
greater gains in-muscle mass and in muscle strength if you 
consume more protein that is what-being advised so if you 
go towards 1.2 or even 1.4 1.6 now going even higher-than 
that I think it's it's it's not re relevant it's not use 
it's not necessary-it's also a bit of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy because if your body adapts to-more protein it 
will need more protein so that is that is just natural-in 
in the situation your body adapts to its use so you can 
actually maintain-your your body mass on a low protein 
intake and on a high protein intake and-there there must be 
a Sweet Spot somewhere and I think most people are-spending 
too much time thinking about what sweet spot is because the 
point8-hardly any whether we're talking about young or old 
there's hardly anybody-consuming 08 if you're a healthy 
older or a healthy young sedentary person you-easily 
consume between 1 and 1.3 gram of protein per kilog body 
mass per day I-mean if 10 to 15 energy percent of your diet 
is protein you easily get to 1 to-1.3 and that's also 
people that don't take supplements or just don't 
think-about the nutrition if we see Elder leap of older 
people in in our test between 1-and 1.3 now if you're an 
atlet and you're exercising you eat more simply-because you 
need to be in energy balance 10 to 15 energy per comes 
from-protein so if you're physically active you 
automatically already consume 1.5-1.6 1.7 grams of protein 
do the math think about uh to the France cyclist-they're 
not big guys they actually expend about uh 25 megga of of 
energy on-a daily B on a daily basis in in the T of France 
if only 10% of that comes from-protein they already consume 
well above two it's not what they need but people-are too 
worried about the total amount of protein they're already 
getting-enough protein if they stay in energy balance it 
becomes more important when-you actually can't eat a lot of 
food then it's then the puzzle becomes more-difficult what 
about people that are are not in energyy Balance let's say 
there-are people that are undergoing energy restriction to 
change body composition-do protein requirements is is it 
beneficial to change protein-requirements and perhaps 
increase them in that specific condition what we-typically 
see when people try to lose weight for example so if they 
on a-hyperic diets is that they lose that they um if they 
eat less-and they try to maintain their absolute amount of 
protein the decline in muscle-mass is less so maintenance 
of your absolute daily protein intake is more-important and 
that's exactly what relates what I said before your 
body-adapts to a certain amount of protein and if you 
suddenly reduce the protein-intake that might go at the 
expense of muscle so also when people go into the-hospital 
and they're not exercising they're eating less also because 
of pain-and stuff like that we try to optimize or maintain 
at least the total amount of-protein that they were 
consuming before they went into the hospital that 
will-attenuate or at least attenuate a little bit the 
muscle loss that they have so-maintenance of your normal 
protein intake is an essential thing how does-how does 
resistance training and and training in general change the 
way the-muscle responds to amino acids so exercise 
increases muscle protein-synthesis also uh increases muscle 
protein breakdown but it increases-muscle synthesis to a 
greater extent than it increases muscle breakdown so-net 
balance becomes better that's without food intake if you 
throw protein-on top of that then breakdown is inhibited to 
some extent and protein-synthesis is further increased 
allowing you to adapt and to recondition the-muscle to what 
you're aiming for and that could be like more 
mitochondrial-proteins when you're an endurance athlete or 
my F proteins when you're-becoming a more resistance type 
athlete okay so so is that kind of why you were-saying when 
you let's say you're you're training and then you increase 
your-protein intake to 1.6 to 1.8 let's say you're you're 
going higher and you're-doing that for a while and you're 
your body adapts to that amount then if you-take that away 
and you're still doing the-training then does it adapt 
quickly as well or will you start to lose muscle-mass we 
don't know but I would predict and let's let's do the 
extreme uh-there's anecdotal uh uh reports of people that 
having very high protein-intake diet and then you tell them 
that they don't need that amount of protein-and then they 
do an experiment and they basically say okay you know what 
I'm-going back to 1.5 and I used to be eating so much 
supplements I was sitting-at almost three gram per kilog 
body mass and I bring it back down to 1.5 I'm-losing muscle 
so I'm not doing it anymore I'm not sure what would 
happen-if they actually kept it there for a while because 
it's homeostasis your body-adapts so probably if you're 
consuming more than three gram of protein per-kilogram body 
mass per day the turnover of other tissue and or the 
oxidation of-the protein will probably be at a higher level 
so you can't basically get a new-homeostasis within like 
two or three days uh that requires studies that look-at 
changes over time I mean like I said I mean we we now tell 
everybody that 66-or8 is the minimal requirement I assume 
that that's people that that eat lot-much less protein but 
they still stay in Balance if you go to a third 
world-country of people that are not consuming enough food 
they adapt and so it's also-on the other side I think you 
can adapt to a high protein intake even if you-don't need 
it is it a healthy thing we don't know um do you increase 
the-turnover rates of other tissues we don't know and if 
the turn off is increased is-that a good thing is that a 
bad thing when you say they adapt like for example-with the 
with respect to the extreme like low pro protein diet level 
I mean-they adapt but you know they're not they're not 
building muscle is that is-that correct they're not 
building muscle but they're they're maintaining in an in-in 
a balance in a nitrogen balance until they get older and 
then it's harder to-stay in the balance if you're not 
getting enough protein if they're losing-muscle they're not 
in Balance but again then we're talking about muscle yeah 
and-and and you with the nitrogen balance you measure on a 
whole body level okay-and that's that's one of the reasons 
why you can't translate the protein-requirements directly 
to what is happening in the muscle the muscle just-enjoys 
when it gets more protein it can do it's it's just mod it's 
much more-modulated I mean if you would actually increase 
your liver or your organs by-higher protein intake we would 
probably have a health issue well what about-you've done 
some research on anabolic resistance and maybe you can 
explain to-people what anabolic resistance is and and how 
that is relevant in terms of-protein intake for older 
adults yeah so if you give young healthy people about-20 
grams of a high quality protein you see a maximum 
stimulation of muscle-protein synthesis giving 40 grams did 
not result in a greater muscle protein-synthesis we'll talk 
about the 100 grams later on probably um but so in in the 
in-the next four to six hours after a meal 20 gram Max 20 
gram of protein maximizes-muscle protein synthesis now now 
if you do that the same uh if you do that in-older people 
and you give them the same 20 gram of protein they show a 
lesser-stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and they do 
not reach that same level-and certainly not the maximum 
level so that's what they now call anabolic-resistance we 
see that the same amount of protein does not lead to the 
same-increase of muscle protein synthesis that you see in 
young-people that is now defined I mean Mike reny's group 
was the first to def Define-that as anabolic resistance but 
the question is is what what is causing-anabolic resistance 
is that because of the AG but of course if you 
compare-young and older groups it's not only about age if 
you compare a young and an-older person it's the age it's 
the lifestyle it's the habitual food intake-habitual 
protein intake it's the co the medication the co 
comorbidities that-they have So you you're comparing a lot 
more now one of the strongest things-that increases the 
sensitivity to food intake is physical activity now if 
you-provide if you give an older person an exercise session 
before food intake-their response is almost completely 
normal so much of the responsiveness the-anabolic 
resistance can be overcome by physical activity so my 
question is to-what extent is anabolic resistance not for 
the greatest amount simply uh uh-secondary to a lower 
physical activity level okay so if I'm 
understanding-correctly most of the anabolic resistance 
with older age is attenuated-with physical activity 
resistance training just being Physically Active-well 
that's pretty incredible um because you're right A lot of 
people do-as they get older they do become less Physically 
Active certainly um people-that aren't necessarily focused 
on their exercise right I mean just normal people-that are 
kind of um more active perhaps when they're in in their job 
and then-they retire and then they're not as active I mean 
that's probably the-biggest I think for the general 
population the biggest problem is when-they then retire and 
then they're just sitting at home then no longer-physically 
active so um knowing that anabolic resistance can be 
overcome by-physical activity is mostly overcome is is uh I 
think extremely important for-public health um before we 
kind of dive into some of that a little bit more I-wanted 
to you you mentioned something about being overweight and 
obese with-respect to protein requirements because there in 
the United States there many-people are overweight and 
obese and people like listening to this-podcast might look 
at that number 0.8 grams Peril per kilogram body weight 
and-directly translate that to their weight which could be 
quite high so how does a-person who is overweight and obese 
perhaps it's not as important because-they're probably like 
you said they're consuming enough food so they don't 
have-to worry about it but there are anal people that want 
to think about-calculations no matter what how does that 
person approach how much protein-they should be taking in 
when they are obese or overweight if you would-actually uh 
modulate your protein requirements towards the tissues 
that-require the protein then it would be better to 
basically base it on fat-free-Mass uh because of course a 
lot of the fat mass is not that metabolically-active it's 
most of it is fat Depo so turnover of protein is relatively 
small-compared to the organs and the muscle so if you have 
the fat free Mass all the-organ mass and the muscle and 
actually say like hey 08 for an 80 year old uh or-880 
kilogram weighing man then also related to the 08 based on 
those 80 kogs-and not on the 20 or 40 excess fat depos that 
you have on you so people most-people um aren't going and 
measuring their fat-free Mass but that is-something that 
can be done people can go get would you say doing a dexa 
scan-would be um something that would be more I mean there 
there's so many options I-mean you can make a body volume 
scan you can there's nice apps nowadays we heard-it 
yesterday in the conference also uh but you can also do a 
dexa scan or body-circumference measurements or but most 
people know how much overweight they are-come on I mean if 
you know if you're 180 you know that somewhere between 80 
and-uh and and for for for meale you should be somewhere 
between 80 and 90 kilogram-if you're 110 it's probably you 
have about 20 20 kilograms excess and now-taking myself as 
as an example you know how much overweight you are most 
people-do no doubt yeah um with respect to the resistance 
training sort of how it's-tied to protein intake and 
increases in uh muscle mass and even strength would-would 
be something I'm interested in because there have been some 
meta-analyses St Philips um did did a really nice one where 
um they looked at protein-increasing protein intake and 
increases in they said lean body mass and then-also 
strength and it was what kind of was striking to me and 
stood out to me-was that with increasing amounts of protein 
so when you start to get up to-like for younger people 1.6 
grams per kilogram body weight was associated with-a modest 
increase in muscle mass but it was very minor increase in 
strength and-these were people that were doing resistance 
training and and the same-went with for for elderly um they 
started to actually have increases in-muscle mass that a 
little bit lower they were 1.2 gram per kilogram body 
weight-and it was the same modest increases in muscle mass 
and minor increases in-strength and that's where I felt 
like I thought muscle mass strength was easier-to gain with 
resistance training than muscle mass so I'm wondering is 
this-something to do with the ma like measuring lean body 
mass or maybe just-the resistance training program wasn't 
robust enough to improve strength I mean-so I think that 
the N the nutritional benefits in gaining muscle mass 
and-strength depends on the availability of protein and the 
gaining of muscle mass-of course and then also the capacity 
to do that training because they also-interact of course 
but if you go back like hey the fat-free Mass could also 
be-a little bit organ mass of course and so maybe some of 
that gain inet free mass-is actually in the organs and not 
necessarily in the muscle that's also-possible um but 
muscle mass and muscle strength are not that tightly 
regulated-or not coupled if as you think I mean you know 
that yourself if if you go to-the gym and you have never 
been there the first four five weeks you see that-your 
strength goes up tremendously I mean you take that that 
that pin and you-put it on 20 kilograms and a week later 
you put it on 30 and four weeks later-you put it on 40 you 
think this is awesome and think you how much strength-am I 
am I gaining and then you're looking in the mirror and 
you're-thinking like nothing much has has been been 
changing I still look the same and-then you don't get back 
to the gym anymore and you just quit 90% of the-people 
listening including myself that happens so the gain in 
strength is the-first step the body tries to uh generate 
more strength with the the stuff that it-has and most of 
that is neuromuscular and then when the body-constantly is 
being driven to do more than it wants then it starts 
thinking-like okay now it maybe becomes more efficient to 
build some extra muscle I-mean it would be strange if the 
muscle starts starts building extra muscle-simply because 
you overexerted yourself once it's a very energy costly 
uh-process to build more muscle so it takes a while so 
first you gain strength and-then you actually follow up 
with more muscles so there's also a time uh-relationship 
between the two also the other way around I mean when we 
become-older we lose more strength than can be explained by 
the-amount of muscle that we have lost so there's also a 
neuromuscular component-and of of course if you then start 
training these people first few weeks-even months you don't 
see that much but the strength goes way up so those 
two-things are not one-on-one it's not a proportional in 
your relationship can-you give a little bit of a range in 
terms of maybe not exact because you-might probably don't 
know but with respect to that time course so like when-you 
start to do resistance training and your strength is going 
up like you said-like how much longer of a lag before you 
start to perhaps visually see or even if-you're measuring 
it can see increases in actual muscle mass yeah that 
depends-that depends on the type of training where you're 
coming from uh what your-what your body mass is I mean uh 
you can hide a six-pack pretty well if if you-have a lot of 
excess fat of course so uh that really depends on on the on 
on the-type of program that you do and and the body morph 
that you have so okay well-maybe we can talk we can get 
into that a little bit more in a minute I wanted to-kind of 
continue on the nutrition part with with Pro prot 
distribution you've-done a lot of research in this area as 
well and I had done some some reading-preparing for this 
podcast on like some of the nutritional surveys that are 
done-in the United States they're called and Hanes in terms 
of like how are people-typically Distributing their protein 
amongst their meals and I think probably-it's very similar 
to what's found in Europe where people are eating 
the-majority of their protein is skewed towards their 
evening meal their last-meal of the day and um in in in 
most cases at least with respect to this-anhan data it's 
about three times the amount of protein in their in 
their-evening meal versus their morning meal or even their 
afternoon meal does it-matter with respect to you know how 
the muscle responds to amino acids-throughout the day like 
is it better to evenly have your protein evenly-distributed 
or can you skew it in the evening and still have the same I 
don't-want to just say increases in mus muscle protein 
synthesis because as you-mentioned that doesn't always 
translate to gains and muscle mass people are 
more-interested in gains and muscle mass so let's let's 
leave it with that end point-so we try to make it more 
simple but it is actually much more complex but if 
you-consider that a single meal containing 20 grams of a 
high quality protein-maximizes muscle protein synthesis for 
up to 4 to 6 hours then it makes the-most sense that every 
main meal throughout today is an anabolic stimulus-so that 
you would have 20 to 25 gram of protein in your breakfast 
20 to 25 gram-of protein in your lunch and 20 to 25 25 
grams of protein in your in your dinner-and then 
theoretically you have three anabolic stimuli throughout 
the day-helping you to optimize muscle building not muscle 
building muscle-reconditioning I actually make that mistake 
all the time by saying that it's-not about muscle build 
building it's optimizing muscle condition and that-could be 
for the endurance athlete that would be better muscle to do 
endurance-type exercise and for the bodybuilder that might 
be a bigger muscle that's the-that's what now everybody's 
being advised for athletes that consume more-than those 75 
grams of protein that you can also add another meal moment 
and-that's for example the pre-sleep uh evening snack for 
example if you-exercise in the evening you take a protein 
Rich snack after that exercise-session in the evening and 
when you had dinner for example at 4: 5 or 6 and you-have a 
training session between 700 and 9 you have a protein Rich 
snake a snack-at 9: before you go to bed at say 11: and so 
that's what a lot of athletes do-just have a nice 
distribution to throughout the day the long-term 
studies-long-term semi longterm on um nitrogen balance or 
on muscle protein synthesis-are not that clear there's some 
studies saying you have better retention of your-of your 
protein and of your nitrogen when you actually have a 
nice-distribution but we've also have a recent study that 
we show that if you-have a huge meal you have a greater 
anabolic response when you assess it-over a more prolonged 
period of time now a lot of people are now asking us 
like-should I have one meal uh no it's a study to show that 
the-sixh hour or the 4H hour response to a single meal can 
be longer if you give-more protein because all the protein 
still needs to be digested and absorbed-but that doesn't 
change what I think now from all the evidence that we have 
it's-being advised to have a nice even distribution of your 
protein in your-main meals so let's talk a little bit about 
that that study since you brought-it up because um it was 
surprising to to many people maybe you can talk a 
little-bit about the difference in terms of the quantity it 
was like 100 grams of-protein versus what has previously 
been shown maybe 30 I think grams of protein-was was 
something that's been shown in terms of Max iing now this 
was muscle-protein synthesis y that you were looking at y 
so the older studies there-are there's two basically two 
dose response studies that show in healthy-young people um 
at rest or after exercise 20 grams maximizes muscle-protein 
synthesis for somewhere between uh 4 to 6 hours after the 
meal so in-that time period four to 6 hour post brandal 
period we call-that some of that protein might not have 
been digested and absorbed if you give-more than those 20 G 
so the 40 G that they showed in those studies didn't show-a 
greater response but they only measured for four or 6 hours 
were-depending now we wanted to do a study to show that if 
you give 100 grams which is-absolutely not something that 
I'm suggesting that people should be-consuming that it 
takes longer to digest everything and that you have a 
longer-stimulation of muscle protein synthesis over a more 
long period of time so we-also measured not over 6 hours 
but over 12 and even 24 hours and then we see-that you get 
a greater response now the interesting part of this study 
is is we-also assessed digestion and absorption now that is 
difficult because how do you-do this now instead of 
infusing tracers only and measuring the incorporation 
in-muscle that's how you measure muscle protein synthesis 
we actually did an-experiment before that we infused the 
cow with labeled amino acids so you have-Amino acids with a 
chemical flag stable isotope labeled we Infuse it in a 
cow-the cow actually incorporates it in the milk so we have 
milk protein and we-extract the milk we extract the milk 
protein so we have milk protein where-those labeled amino 
acids are Incorporated and then we provide that-protein so 
we can see the digestion we see those labeled amino acids 
coming out-of the protein being releas to the circulation 
then we take a blood sample-we can actually see those amino 
acids so we see how much of the protein that you-ingest is 
released in the circulation and then we can even see how 
much is Con-converted to muscle and then you see that it 
takes much longer to get all-those amino acids in the 
circulation and also to get a longer stimulation of-muscle 
protein synthesis so simply regard also the fact that time 
is a is a-factor in all of this but of course we most of us 
eat one meal and then four to-6 hours later the second meal 
and that's why all the previous studies always-looked at 
four to 6 hour post perenial periods unless it's your last 
meal of-the evening good point so the question then is if 
you if it's your last meal in-the evening and you know 
let's say you've already distributed your protein-intake 
fairly decently in your first two meals some people will 
talk about a-minute time restricted eating and caloric 
restriction but um and and let's-say you you want to go a 
little higher for your maybe not all the way to 100-grams 
but you know 60 whatever then would you have would you if 
you-speculate on this and this kind of this there's two 
parts to this question would-you think that the the 
increase in muscle protein synthesis would be higher-if you 
had ingested 60 grams of protein in that last male 
versus-25 throughout the evening like we're talking like 12 
20 hours and also what-if you then wake up in the morning 
and then you have again your first meal is-that going to 
change the muscle protein synthesis or are you better off 
having-that meal higher are you going to get just are you 
really maximizing it I I-love those questions because the 
the the three questions that you now asked is-probably 
seven years of my life so um what we so one of the things 
how I-should start answering this is that we see a lot of 
people in the hospital-losing muscle and so they're 
admitted to hospital losing a lot of muscle and we-know 
that the the loss of muscle or muscle m is an important 
predictor of-clinical complications readmission Health Etc 
so we wanted to do something-for patients to reduce muscle 
muscle loss so we thought like if we give these-just in 
less with athletes if we give these elderly people another 
meal in the-evening can we minimize muscle loss or 
stimulate muscle protein synthesis now-when you're in the 
hospitals probably hear the same thing you get your 
last-meal about 5 or 6:00 in the evening and then the next 
meal is breakfast the next-day at 9: so you spend more than 
15 16 17 hours in-an overnight fasted state which is maybe 
nice for for people trying to lose-weight or anything like 
that but for people at risk of muscle muscle loss-it's not 
a good thing so we started thinking about if you give 
protein in-the evening is it digested while you sleep does 
this all work while while you-sleep now that's difficult 
because you can't take muscle biopsies when somebody-sleeps 
and not wake the person up and you also can't ingest 
protein while was-sleeping so what we did is and that's 
when we started doing studies with the-older people the 
great volunteers much better than most of the athletes 
that-they call us and then they actually say like look I 
was in your lab last year-can I come back do you have a new 
study running and then then I would say-something like oh 
yeah you can come over what we'll do we put a nasogastric 
tube-down your nose in your gut we take a muscle biopsy 
then we put you to bed in-the hospital then at 2:00 at 
night while you're sleeping we'll tiptoe into in-into your 
next to your bed put 40 grams of pro protein in your gut 
and then wake-you up in the morning at 7:00 with a muscle 
biopsy and then they respond like-where can I sign sign up 
or when can I come over so these are cool studies but-they 
showed that if you give um 40 grams of protein in the 
evening that protein-is digested and absorbed while you 
sleep because we use that intrinsically-labeled protein so 
we could follow it and it's actually converted to 
muscle-now that study was weird because when we publ that 
that was a nice proof of-principle study I got a lot of 
coaches and and people calling me asking me-where they 
could buy those naog gastic tubes and I said like like no 
this is a-proof of principle study just have a protein Rich 
snack in the evening so-just to make that clear we actually 
follow that up with an at lead study-where we showed that 
having a protein Rich snack in the evening is digested-and 
absorbed and stimulates muscle protein synthis overnight 
and so that-amount of protein will help you reconditioning 
more-efficiently that's the first answer to your or the 
question to your first first-question now the second was is 
it of benefit on top of knowing that you'll-have breakfast 
and lunch the next day so we also did that study we 
provided-protein in the evening or we didn't provide 
protein in the evening and-looked at the response to 
breakfast now response to breakfast in both conditions-was 
exactly the same to my surprise because I expected if you 
give a lot of-protein the evening before then the response 
to breakfast would be minimized-but it wasn't it was 
exactly the same so it does give me some insight that 
at-least in the first 24 hours you have a greater benefit 
when you provide-sufficient protein to maximize the 
reconditioning what about people so Tim-restricted eating 
you mentioned a lot of people are do practice time 
restricted-eating and they're eating in an 8 Hour window 
and they're in for 16 hours and-you've done some research 
in this area as well so can you eating that that-large 
evening you know that large protein Bolis with your last 
meal you-know what if it's earlier and it's not like right 
before sleep because you have-your your feeding window your 
eating window and then you have your fasting-window do you 
think based on your your study with a 100 grams of protein 
really-extreme case that that protein will be digested 
longer and incorporated into-muscle for muscle protein 
synthesis So based on the theory that you need an-anabolic 
stimulus every every main meal in order to get the optimal 
24-hour-response then you would actually have to conclude 
that intermittent fasting of-Tim restricted feeding is not 
a good thing but uh we've done a study a more-longer term 
study IMA did that with labeled water and she did that when 
um-in in Melbourne where I had a visiting professorship 
position there and we-didn't see a difference in muscle 
protein synthesis with the Tim-restricted eating versus the 
the non-time restricted eating so it's-possible the 
explanation is that if you have a period to where there's 
less uh-or there's no food intake but you had a greater 
meal as the last one that-actually also had a greater 
response over a more long period of time just-like the 100 
gam study so it's possibly that that evens it out the other 
big-question is of course why would you do Tim restrictive 
eating or um um-intermittent fasting um the other thing on 
on that study was we didn't see-differences or that project 
I should say is we didn't see a difference in fat-loss so 
and I have a lot of people calling me and saying like but 
Tim-restricted eating uh intermittent fasting really works 
for me now I I did-it myself as well it works really well 
why because in the morning I go to work-I don't think about 
food because I'm too busy and everybody's just walking 
into-my office by around 4:00 I get like a little bit pish 
so I start eating-something and then I get home around 6 
and around 7 I open up the computer to-see what crap emails 
I got and then I start having my main meal and snacking-if 
I decide to not eat after 6 I will eat much less than I 
actually-require so I'll lose weight so basically because 
More than 70% of my energy-intake is after 7 :00 at night 
Tim restricted eating would be great for me-but if I would 
eat all the food that I would eat after 7 throughout the 
day I-would lose or I would not lose that fat moss and I 
would not lose weight so it's-a good way for people to cope 
with a lower energy intake right I think-there's now been 
many many studies that have done that have found that 
people-naturally doing time restricted eating you know in 
their free living conditions-on on average reduce their 
calorie and 200 calories per day and and that's just-you 
know natural because people don't snack or they don't eat 
that dessert or-they skip you know because they are trying 
to to restrict their their meals-into a shorter time period 
but and I think you've even shown this and other-studies 
many Studies have shown while if you do keep calories the 
same you will-not lose fat-free mass and weight right um 
then glucose the glucose homeostasis-is still improved by 
not eating in a huge you like by restricting your 
time-eating window shorter to let's say eight hours you 
know in some cases 10 but-mostly eight even shorter than 
that six hours so there are there are people also-that are 
very interested in their glucose homeostasis that you know 
want-to eat within a a shorter time window as well but the 
question then goes is well-if they were skipping meals or 
skipping snacks then they're potentially skipping-protein 
intake right if someone is doing the time restricted eating 
schedule-where they're eating within an 8- hour window then 
they really do need to make-sure they're they're not losing 
their their their protein correct yes and so-if they 
maintain the normal protein intake then they should be fine 
uh-because it's possible that more protein per meal has a 
greater effect like the-100 grams but the other part is 
also I mean let's not I mean it's it's funny-but we always 
end up talking about nutrition and then we don't talk 
about-the physical activity um because I mean the same 
thing people ask me like what-should I eat to to to lose 
weight and I always say less uh because there is no-magic 
bullet but the physical activity we know from all 
hypercaloric diets that-if you actually are are on a 
hypercaloric diet that two sessions of-resistance exercise 
throughout the week prevents the lean mass loss-so maybe 
instead of focusing on the protein focus on physical 
activity in-order to maintain your fat free mass by doing 
two resistance exercise sessions a-week much more important 
than than the protein so let me rephrase my question-for 
someone who's doing time restricted eating in an 8 Hour 
window fasting for-16 hours and they're engaged in 
resistance training at least three times-a week minimum and 
they're taking in their protein they're not they're 
not-missing their protein and and they the resistance and 
yes can they gain muscle-mass can they gain it yes yes okay 
that's an absolute yes I mean there's-even studies that um 
so again um8 g of protein you can actually gain-muscle on8 
gram of protein maybe you can gain more muscle on 1.2 but 
you can-still gain muscle on A8 gram protein per kilogram 
body mass per day the body is-much smarter than we think if 
you actually do exercise and we ingest the-same protein 
that we can trct throughout the body we see that the same 
amount of-proteins of course digested and absorbed but more 
goes to the lag that it-exercise so there's also an 
efficiency effect physical activity makes you more-of what 
you just ate so more of the protein is actually converted 
when you-perform physical activity so the body gets smarter 
how it handles protein I-have a question so if we we were 
talking about protein distribution and perhaps-you know 
being beneficial to more evenly distribute protein but how 
does physical-activity because you said physical activity 
sensitizes I mean your your did-you said it sensitizes 
muscle to amino acids um how does that does that 
change-whether I mean you would think that in the 
background of someone who's-Physically Active does all 
these other little differences matter I think so I-mean all 
it's all those little things that matter I mean to look at 
the-cyclist it's the bike it's the helmet it's the it's the 
it's it's the-nutrition it's it's the training it's the 
mental coaching and all of this-together make the better 
atlet so it's all these small things but um so what 
is-interesting to see is that you have an anabol olic 
response to feeding you have-an anabolic response to 
exercise you have an anabolic response a greater-anabolic 
response when you compare the to now the nice thing is that 
uh I think-number question number one the most the question 
I was are being asked the most-is do I need to take the 
protein before or after the exercise session which 
is-almost the same question you asking should I do the 
exercise before the meal-or after the meal it's basically 
Al also the same thing it doesn't really matter-that much 
because exercise makes the muscle more sensitive to the 
stimulation-of muscle protein synthesis through food intake 
but it does so for up to 24 to-even 48 hours so if you do 
an exercise session today your response to 
breakfast-tomorrow morning will be greater but also lunch 
tomorrow afternoon and also-dinner tomorrow night and so 
after that you have your second exercise session so-it's 
not about what should go first but it's a consistency of 
training and meals-in between and the training will make 
your me more efficient in how they-optimize muscle 
reconditioning well the thing that's so interesting about 
this-recent study that you published on on the higher dose 
of protein and that-being incorporated into muscle is so if 
you have that 24-hour anabolic window as-you're as you're 
saying and you're going to be more sensitive to amino 
acids-throughout that 24 hours of course then every meal so 
if you have you know 10-meals on the extreme end okay every 
10 you know 10 m 10 times of protein you're-going to be 
sensitive to that protein because it's still within that 
24-hour-window however if you don't have time because 
you're working as you you know-said to eat three or four or 
five meals throughout the day it's also nice to-know that 
you can go a little further than 30 G in those let's say 
three meals-and perhaps still get a similar amount of 
muscle protein synthesis in fact let-me ask you to 
speculate let's say a person with did two people or the 
same-person and you did a crossover study with a do both 
conditions they're-they're doing their resistance training 
their anabolic windows 24 hours they're-sensitive to the 
amino acids the first time they're eating you know let's 
say-what 80 grams of of protein they're doing that within 
five meals or they're-going to do it within three do you 
think they'll have the same amount of gains in-muscle mass 
um this is I mean this is cool study but I think if 
there's-differences there will be two too small to pick up 
that's one if you would have-each of those meals would have 
20 gr so it's depending on total protein intake-if you do 
for example 5 time 20 or 2 * 50 does that make sense I 
don't think-you'll find any difference there if you would 
do uh I would be more less sure-about my case if you would 
do 20 * 5 grams versus uh 3 * 33.3-okay that maybe maybe 
there's a difference that you don't reach that so-so-called 
locing threshold but to be honest if there's-the day before 
there's physical activity a good training session if the 
lags-involved I'm not so sure whether we would be able to 
pick up a difference-there okay so it is it it's pure 
theory of course yeah speculation essentially-it you know 
it sounds like certainly in the context of training in 
the-background that you can skew your protein somewhat with 
yes your meals and-and and still not be missing out on what 
you otherwise would gain in muscle mass-rather not worry 
about that but don't miss that training session 
absolutely-that's the essential thing that's the that's the 
Baseline right you have to-but the more people talk about 
nutrition the less they're actually doing the-training 
that's what you often see I know it's true it's absolutely 
true and-I do we're going to I'd like to continue on the 
nutrition because you've done so-much re research in this 
area but I want to get to the training but um we've 
been-talking about protein like this General thing like 
protein and so there's food-sources of protein there's 
supplemental sources of protein there's plant sources-of 
protein meat sources of protein so I was kind of wanting to 
start maybe with-just let's talk about animal sources 
because most people are eating meat and-fish and poultry 
Dairy and dairy yes like how in terms of you know 
skeletal-muscle protein synthesis in terms of gaining 
muscle mass if you're having the-same amount of protein on 
a gram basis from food versus um a protein shake and-it 
probably will depend on the type of protein shake but is 
there going to be-differences in gains in muscle mass not 
measurable but of course I mean if we if-if you assess 
muscle protein synthesis if you get Whole Foods in from a 
from-from a animal based you might get a little bit more 
sluggish response saying-the increase in circulating 
essential amino acids and Lucine in particular-will be uh 
less rapid than when you actually ingest say 300 Ms of a 
protein-shake with the Protein Isolate or the or the 
protein concentrate but we will-never be able to to to 
actually pick up those differences because they will 
be-very very very minimal but now we're talking about uh 
meat that is cooked uh-eggs that are cooked uh because then 
we see that actually digestion and-absorption is very rapid 
and we see almost the same increase in essential-amino acid 
and lucing then when you get the isolator concentrate okay 
so of-course there's differences because if you're eating 
food you're getting-vitamins and minerals and fatty acids 
and all the other important-micronutrients and 
macronutrients that are required for and if you have 
these-these products are coming in a combined meal because 
that's typically something-that has much less research 
being done we're starting to do that now but it's-it's 
often complicated because uh then you have all these 
different products-coming together you have 
anti-nutritional factors I don't like-the term 
anti-nutritional factors but that's what they call them but 
you have-fibers you have more energy so your gastric 
emptying is reduced so-everything gets more sluggish and 
then it gets more difficult to compare stuff-so so it 
always depends whether you have your your protein isolate 
concentrate-whether you have your whole food product or you 
have that whole food product in a-meal that will change the 
Dynamics of digestion and absorption and therefore-also the 
direct impact on muscle protein synthesis but when you say 
sluggish I-mean you do you just mean delayed it's 
essentially those amino acids will get-to the muscle but 
it'll take longer correct okay well in that sense the 
I-mean we're talking in the absolute sense gains in muscle 
mass then it doesn't-really make a difference if you're 
doing the animal Source we're talking about-animal Source 
right now yes because if I mean if it's sufficient if it's 
20 gram-you get above a certain threshold and you'll 
definitely have the full anabolic-signaling that you expect 
the most okay but of course people are also interested-in 
not getting they're they're if they're doing caloric 
restriction and-and basically trying to change their body 
composition protein shakes can help-with that if they're 
lower in calories lower in fat and then you're getting-your 
protein without the other fat sources so so I always uh 
advise people-to uh get most of the nutrients from their 
diet and not from supp say as I-discussed this morning um 
but uh what is interesting sometimes Sports Nutrition-or 
supplements can be used to make it more practically 
feasible to do it and I-always use for students and I use 
the example is for example a sports drink a-sports drink 
gets you the carbohydrates during exercise you can also do 
that-with a plate of of of spaghetti but it's not that easy 
to Cy on a bike when you-have a plate spaghetti in front of 
you front of your nose so it's an easier way-to get the 
nutrients you need in a setting that is Sport specific now 
if-you're in a gym and you want to take a certain amount of 
protein and you don't-want to make a short short meal and 
you want to restrict calories yeah then-sometimes a protein 
shake is easy easier is there a difference with respect 
to-the source of protein supplements so for example if it's 
sourced from casine-versus w versus egg white protein with 
respect to we're talking about skeletal-muscle protein 
synthesis and presumably increases the muscle mass yep so 
this is-stuff that we the whole intrinsic labeled cows the 
cow infusion getting-intrinsic labeled milk and we 
extracted whey and casine in order to to show the-the 
digestion and absorption kinetics and also the capacity to 
stimulate-muscle protein synthesis now we've done these 
studies years ago and that shows-that myell casine is a 
slowly Digest protein so the increase in 
circulating-essential amino acids in the blood is more 
sluggish than when you ingest whe-protein which is a more 
rapidly digestible protein and so uh the way-protein gets 
or is more rapidly digested greater increases of muscle 
protein-synthesis and also uh has a greater anabolic 
response uh greater increase in-muscle protein synthesis 
now we thought that's maybe only because of the more-rapid 
digestion and absorption so we hydroly the casine make it 
more rapidly-digestible so it was just as easily digested 
and absorbed as the way but it-still had a lesser response 
so that might be due to the lesser amount of-Lucine in 
casine than in Whey whey has a higher Lucine content and we 
know that-Lucine is a is a is a is a is an amino acids that 
has very strong signaling-properties so it stimulates the 
empal pathway and therefore it sets off the-whole anabolic 
Cascade and we also double check that by adding free 
Lucine-on the casine and we got a greater response so in 
short we know that the-anabolic potential of a protein is 
related to the rate of digestion and-absorption and the 
amount of um at least the amount of Lucine in combination 
with-other amino acids and that's the whole basis of why 
whey is more popular with-adlets than uh Kine but the 
differences are very small and so for practice 
in-combination with diets and throughout the whole day all 
the food that you eat-it's very minimal but of course I 
mean I ride a bike that is only 9 kilos uh but-I might have 
actually 15 kilograms of overweight so I could actually do 
with a-much heavier bike but I still want the fastest bike 
and the lightest bike and-so people want the best 
supplement does it make that much of a difference I-don't 
think so that much sitting upright while you eat or 
actually chewing well-has also a huge effect on the rate of 
digestion and absorption so but these-differences exist but 
these the difference are very small if you compare-milk uh 
whey or egg protein oh egg white as well egg egg is also 
great great from-a from from amino acid composition and 
also digestion and absorption it's great-it so you're 
talking about in the real world here you're you think maybe 
to-most people those differences aren't so important to 
some they are like the ones-that are really optimizing 
every just little thing but what about in the-context of 
research and and you know data that's not like you compare 
studies-and someone's using caseine and then you got we and 
then you know then their time-when they do it maybe the 
casine hadn't all you know been absorbed so-conflicting 
data I mean methological differences seems like it might so 
so-all of these things so we're scientists we're trying to 
figure out what are all-the aspects that Define digestion 
and absorption and the capacity to stimulate-muscle protein 
synthesis what we call Post perenial protein handling and 
so we-want to know which which factors play a role but all 
of of course in a normal-situation you have all these 
factors together you have um protein quality um-in what 
Matrix that protein is being ingested from a food or a meal 
how that-protein is processed how you eat it and even the 
body position in which you eat-and so these are all these 
different things and now one of the studies that-we've done 
for example is eat eggs or eat the eggs in a boiled form or 
in a-raw form now this is also a little bit of a joke um 
not a joke but I everybody-knows those knows knows the 
Rocky movies and of course there's some guys in our-lab 
that love uh these these movies and I was actually growing 
up with those-movies so you see Rocky getting up at 5:00 in 
the morning and he gulping down-like five raw eggs and then 
he does his training session now I thought it would-be fun 
to actually see whether instead of having a nature paper 
whether we-could have a paper with a slice alone as a 
co-author so basically what we did we-did a study to see 
what the digestion and absorption and muscle 
protein-synthesis is after ingesting uh raw eggs versus 
cooked eggs um now what is really-nice to see you have 
exactly the same protein but cooking actually denatures-the 
protein and results in much more rapid release of these lab 
of these-amino acids in the circulation and theoretically 
that should also lead to a-greater muscle protein synthesis 
but we provided sufficient EG so probably the-total amount 
of protein was sufficient to maximize the response so on 
muscle-protein synthesis it was exactly the same um so of 
course I send it off to uh-to Sylvester Stallone's home 
address but never got a response unfortunately so 
we-couldn't make him a coold water but the title is still 
was Rocky right or wrong-should you boil your eggs and yes 
boiling is one of the one of the one of-the issues same 
thing as consuming uh how you consume your Foods we did 
study-is sitting upright or lying down which is of course 
very relevant for people in-the hospital because a lot of 
people are being fed lying down but sitting 
upright-actually stimulates gastric emptying so the protein 
actually gets faster in your-digest digestive system you 
get a faster release in in circulating amino acids-and 
therefore a greater stimulation of muscle protein-synthesis 
chewing same thing we infused the cow with labeled amino 
acids for a-Dutch person it's hard to accept that uh only 
20 5% of your expensive Tracer goes-into the milk so we 
butchered the cow so suddenly we had intrinsically 
labeled-meat we provided subjects with that meat provided 
as minced meat or as a steak-huge difference in the rate of 
digestion and absorption so also chewing and-cutting up 
your food is an important factor did now are these 
important so-you're when you're saying that it's a greater 
stimulation in skeletal muscle-protein synthesis at the 
time you measured but will they normalize-eventually over 
time so that it's less of a difference in the real world 
more-of a difference in the lab in terms of when you're St 
I think in the long run-it increases the the efficiency by 
which the protein is being used for muscle and-tissue 
protein synthesis but of course it becomes less relevant 
when you-consume enough protein it becomes more relevant 
when your total food intake is-very low so for example 
people that do not resistance exercise because 
they're-lying in bed and they are they are hurting and they 
actually anabolically-resistant because they also have 
inflammation and sepsis and they can't-eat food and they 
can't chew and they can't sit uppr right then all 
these-factors come together and then you have a very 
dangerous situation and then-having all these little specks 
will greatly improve probably their their-health for the 
healthy person that already consumes a huge load of 
protein-then those difference quality doesn't become so I 
always like to like to put-it this way you can compensate 
for quality by greater quantity and that's-what every 
athlete already does because he or she needs to consume 
more food-because he's more active has a higher energy 
expenditure becomes more-important on on the other scale 
yeah that's it's good to differentiate that-um I want to 
kind of shift back and talk about the the protein Source 
because-we've talked about the animal Source we've talked 
about supplemental sources-of protein from animal products 
y but there's also a large percentage of-people that are 
vegetarian and vegan don't consume any animal products yep 
so-maybe you can tell people a little bit about the 
differences between food-sources um plant sources of 
protein versus animal sources of-protein so first and then 
again I have to make the difference between Whole-Foods 
protein isolates and protein concentrates so if you want to 
consume-protein through plant-based Foods so beans lettuce 
um nuts whatever-is it's more difficult to get a certain 
amount of protein in if you want to-ingest 20 gram of 
protein through eating meat 70 gram of of meat if you want 
to-get 20 gram of protein in by eating potatoes you have to 
eat more than a-kilogram of potatoes so first of all it's 
just more difficult to get the same-amount of protein in if 
you actually consume it as Whole Foods and then when-you 
cons consume that Whole Foods most plant-based foods have 
anti nutritional-factors so the capacity for you to extract 
that protein through your body-is less so the digestability 
is lower those are the two issues when you when-you have 
plant-based Foods now nowadays uh and much of the research 
has looked-at the proteins that are actually in plant-based 
Foods extracted those-proteins and then assessed their 
capacity to stimulate muscle protein-synthesis has been 
done for uh some proteins like uh wheed protein soy-protein 
a lot PE protein uh about five different proteins that that 
we and-others have actually assessed and then some of them 
actually some of these-studies show a lesser capacity to 
stimulate muscle protein synthesis when-compared to an 
equivalent amount of mostly Dairy protein that might 
be-attributed to the fact that there's less Lucine less 
essential amino acids and-sometimes most of the plant-based 
proteins are deficient in one of more-specific amino acids 
that's often methionine and-lysine um The Last 5 Years we 
have been trying the protein extracts from uh p-and gluten 
and corn and actually if we give in healthy subjects we 
give 30-grams which is quite a lot of protein we don't see 
a difference with with dairy-protein so if you give 
sufficient of the protein of the protein extract 
where-digestability is high there's not much that much 
difference in-uh muscle protein synthesis however if you 
would take it from a plant-based-food then on a certain 
equivalent amount of protein less of that protein 
becomes-available and that is of course then you have to 
compensate for that a little bit-so vegans that um are 
interested in gaining muscle mass obviously 
preserving-muscle mass but also gaining muscle mass with 
their resistance training-programs they can supplement with 
protein plant-based protein powder-sources that will allow 
them to on a gram perram basis especially if it's a-high 
enough dose gain the same muscle mass as someone doing 
let's say-animal-based protein supplements um potentially I 
think so so U not NE they-don't necessarily have to 
supplements supplements is probably easier they can-also 
compensate for lesser quality by greater quantity but then 
you have to-consume a huge amount of food and of course you 
improve the quality of your-protein sources by having a 
very diverse pallet of plant-based Foods so if you-really 
know what you're doing from a nutrition perspective 
dietetics-perspective then I think it's quite cap you're 
quite capable doing that on a-vegan diet but it's more 
difficult and of course if you start using 
plant-based-protein isolates or plant derived proteins I 
should say it gets-easier and what about so you mentioned P 
protein is what you looked at in your-studying compared to 
to Dairy when 30 grams and 30 gr there was no difference-in 
terms of skeleton muscle protein synthesis what about so is 
is p protein-different from rice protein in terms of its 
amino acid composition is there a-protein powder that's 
better perhaps for vegans that are interested in 
increasing-their their muscle mass so so we we we we 
basically years ago we looked at all-the commercially 
available protein extracts so protein uh plant 
plant-derived proteins and then you see that some of them 
are actually low in loine-but some just as corn is actually 
higher and loosen than most animal derived-proteins so not 
all plant-based proteins are the-same um the deficiencies 
in lysine and methionine is also one protein can be-very 
deficient in methionine the other one is actually deficient 
lysine but not-the methionine so there's not one specific 
protein that I would say that-one is the best but you can 
you can mix up and blend different plant-based uh-proteins 
that together have a very n nice protein balanced amino 
acid profile-so combinations are great what we expected 
from our studies with the-individual proteins that they 
would actually show a lesser response and that-by adding 
some milk protein we would actually compensate for that but 
in all-those proteins like the P protein we actually did 
not find a lesser muscle-protein synthetic response but I 
do need to note that we did that with 30 grams-of a protein 
extract so you don't have the digestability-issue what 
would be so you you mentioned lysine and methionine maybe 
you can-explain to people why those are also important you 
mentioned Lucine and how-that stimulates mtor and that's 
important for muscle protein synthesis-but um what why is 
lysine and methionine important and then maybe also why 
would-uh what would be a good combination of plant sourced 
protein powders perhaps to-get all those like you said P 
protein is there something else in combination with-P that 
would cover all the bases yeah so one of the things I mean 
um some amino-acids may have stronger signaling properties 
but of course if you're-trying to build a protein you need 
all the building blocks all the different-building blocks 
and that includes methionine and lysine of course so 
you-need sufficient of all the amino acids now you can 
actually take blends with-and we used a blend with three 
different plant-based proteins and that worked-fine um but 
you also see that some combinations for example one's low 
low-in methine and the other one low in lysine they 
actually make make nice-Blends and funny enough if you 
start looking at those proteins then you-suddenly realize 
that all over the world people are consuming meals that 
actually-have proteins that are very nicely compository or 
matching and so when I-saw those data the first times I 
suddenly realized why a fajita actually-has beans in it so 
the wheat and the beans is actually a nice 
compliment-complimentary amino acid the amino acid mix so 
it's really funny if you see that-somewhere people have 
actually noticed that or experienced that and 
then-sprouting I think also some of the you can get 
sprouted quinoa source of-protein where it's getting away 
some of the um as as you mentioned like some of-these anti 
nutritional components like the fiber Matrix that are you 
know in-some cases other lectin and um they they sort of 
inhibiting some of the-absorption of protein what about I 
Protein Isolate versus con-concentrate which one is is it 
better to consume Protein Isolate for higher-protein I 
would prefer the product where the protein actually is in 
so not even-the isolate or the concentrate but then if 
you're using a supplement and you-want to take the pure 
protein then you can take the isolate or the 
concentrate-concentrate the isolate is only the protein the 
concentrate is basically-yeah the concentrated protein so 
it still has other stuff like for milk-protein concentrate 
it still has lactose in it and still has some uh some 
some-other stuff some fat and there um so yeah is one 
better than the other no it-depends on what you're what 
you're aiming for what your nutrient nutrients-targets are 
basically yeah if if someone's interested in lower 
fat-content and more protein content yeah then you would go 
for an isolate of-course Protein Isolate okay so you you 
we've talked about locing and um you-know how it's it's 
very important for activating mtor can you talk a 
little-bit about the locing threshold and how resistance 
training physical activity-change is that loosing threshold 
yeah so the if you ingest 20 gram of protein you-see a a 
strong Robo increase in muscle protein synthesis that Peaks 
around 3-hours after a meal and then it wears off in about 
about five six hours now one of-the factors in that 
response is Lucine the postprandial increase in 
circulating-Lucine sets off an anabolic pathway in the 
muscle and is responsible for that-stimulation of muscle 
protein synthesis um-20 gram for whey protein that will be 
about two gram of two to three gram to-two and a half grams 
of Lucine so you can also give that as uh free Lucine or-as 
the branchin amino acids and we've done that as well we Al 
also see that-very strong increase in muscle protein syn 
first two hours but then it wears-off much more rapid so 
you need the Lucine to-stimulate the process but then you 
also need a sufficient supply of all the-amino acids to 
allow muscle protein synthesis to continuing to continue 
for-a while so it's it's a double whammy it's both the 
signaling and supplying-enough of the building blocks and 
that's that's the loosing threshold now-exercise reduce 
makes the like we said before exercise makes the muscle 
more-sensitive to the anabolic properties of protein 
feeding so it theoretically it-reduces your Lucine 
threshold so with a lesser increase in Lucine you 
would-actually get a greater Muscle Pro synthesis and of 
course how I translate-it is when you perform physical 
activity the muscle is more interested in having-enough 
building blocks than the signaling process because the 
signaling-process has already been fully activated by 
the-exercise so here's another question for you um I know 
that exercise causes-Branch chain amino acids like Lucine 
to be taken up into skeletal muscle like-from circulation 
so you know Lucine these amino acids are doing lots 
of-things in multiple tissues like you know it's going into 
the brain it's getting-transported in the brain for example 
um but the excises causing causes Lucine-more Lucine to be 
taken up into skeletal muscle-so does that I don't know if 
it's proper to even-call it the loosing threshold but like 
can you then um you know take take in-more Lucine and and 
get it more into the muscle where it's like where it used 
to-be like oh after three grams or whatever then you're not 
going to really do much-more do you think exercise would in 
a way almost make it where you could-consume even more 
Lucine are you if I if I actually understand what you're 
saying-you're suggesting that the exercise induced lowering 
of the Lucine threshold-is potentially at least partly 
explained by a greater Lucine influx in the muscle-yeah 
that's possible yeah well it kind of it leads me to this 
next question-that um has to do with cardiovascular disease 
and I'm sure you saw this this-headline that claimed high 
protein diets it was an animal study that claimed-getting 
22% of your calories from protein was going to 
cause-atherosclerosis um there was some some human data in 
that study looking-specifically at and identifying they 
identified Lucine as a major driver of-this because Lucine 
in circulation activates macroasia which are one part-of a 
sto of the bigger larger story in atherosclerosis I was 
wondering what-your thoughts are on I know it's not your 
study but on high protein diets-High I mean first of all 
can you even translate that sort of study to humans-when 
you're you know consuming 22% of your calories from protein 
and and-that's causing a probably wouldn't would not have 
seen the study and but it was-actually in our papers and I 
did get already some some some questions about-it from from 
the from the the General Media um if I remember correctly 
is um I-think the title of that paper was not that 
suggestive but all the followup-reports on that paper were 
extremely suggestive and absolutely not in line-with the 
with the the outcome or the results in that study so what 
they did-is they provided if I remember correctly they 
provided um two meals or two drink-so something with a high 
protein content and a low protein content in humans 
and-then they took blood samples for I don't know a few 
hours after that meal and-then they actually to took the um 
the monocytes I think so the microf fages in-the blood and 
they um saw that they actually were activated and then they 
uh-they did an initro study to see which factor was 
actually stimulating mtop the-tempor pathway in those 
microf fages and that was locen duh could have 
imagined-that it's Ry tissue and then they gave a high 
protein diet and a low protein diet-to rodents and they saw 
also activation of the microf fages and that was-suggestive 
of them developing arteriosclerosis yes and I think 
they-had some other markers of arteriosclerosis as well but 
yes but so-first of all we're not rodents um and then the 
uh few hours of-uh circulating amino acids is not 
reflective of what happens over days-over 24 hours over 
weeks over months in the development of Aros closes in 
humans-so I think that the uh the translation is a little 
bit over the top and that's-an understatement-um it's with 
all these things high protein is not causing any issues 
high-fat is not causing any issues high glucose or high 
carbohydrate is not-causing issues when it's only high and 
not excess and that's the diff-difference the most the 
greatest problems with chronic metabolic disease-is excess 
energy excess energy in the form of glucose excess energy 
in the-form of fat excess energy in the form of of protein 
it's all bad and we have we-have all the mechanisms have 
been shown for glucose fatty acids and amino acids-in for 
example inducing insulin resistance if you oversupply a 
nutrient-at some point you become resistant to it and that 
and then the body doesn't know-what to do with it and you 
get issues if your Milkman comes by with every day-with two 
bottles of milk and you only drink one it's not going to 
cost a lot-more days before you start calling him to bring 
you less milk that's what your-muscle also does at some 
point it says like hey I can't store more because 
this-storage is hurting me so it's not about high glucose 
or high fat or high protein-it's excess excess is the 
problem right and and that's where exercise and-physical 
activity is key because you are not only you know I mean 
most of the-time you're you are of course you burning 
energy so you can consume more-but you are your muscle's 
taking up glucose it's taking up the protein it's-taking up 
Lucine so it's not in circulation activating macroasia 
right-so the exercise and and there's even been studies 
that I've looked at for-example you know people that are 
consuming meat versus um you know a-vegan source of protein 
and and how you know cancer mortality is higher in 
these-meat eaters it's all cause mortality is higher in 
meat eaters but when you then-do a subgroup analysis and 
you say okay I only want the meat eaters that have 
no-unhealthy lifestyle factors so they're not sedentary 
they're not overweight-obese they're not smoking and 
they're not consuming excess Al alcohol guess-what their 
cancer mortality and all cause mortality was the same as 
people-consuming the plant protein so if you are going to 
be unhealthy and obese and-sedentary and smoke perhaps you 
shouldn't eat a lot of protein 22% of-your your calorie 
shouldn't be coming from from protein um but but 
certainly-when you're physically active and you're healthy 
and you're not overweight and-obese you're not smoking um 
it's it's Pro you probably shouldn't be worried-about 
getting atherosclerosis by eating protein no and some 
sometimes people Mis-misin interpret data of course I mean 
you can say something like hey having a-very high heart 
rate is not good but why do you exercise because-that makes 
your heart rate go up but then your resting heart rate goes 
down-so it's a you have to get the full picture to 
understand I mean you-challenge the body I mean exercise is 
I mean I can I can make a statement I mean-I can make an 
marketing statement that the worst thing to do with the the 
body-is actually doing exercise you cause inflammation you 
cause oxidative stress-it's really bad for you it increases 
heart rate but actually it sets off the-whole process that 
makes you healthier so just looking at what happens with 
one-meal is not giving you the full picture of what it does 
for health I agree-context matters and um 100% And and 
that's really important to keep in mind-um and it's often 
the observational data and animal data that um loses that 
I-like the the the the U the discussions of course of 
hypercaloric diets and-overeating and undereating in the 
light of animal experiments I mean we know-that a lot of 
times when you have rodents in a cage and you give them 
at-Litin Foods they actually overc consume I mean we would 
do the same thing if-you're actually sitting in a room and 
they're bring you constant just warm-crossant and 
everything you're going to overeat so the animals do that 
as well-and then they give them a hypercaloric diet or they 
eat they give them less-food and then they're healthier 
that's not necessarily that-the hypercaloric diet was 
actually making them healthy it is that the-control trial 
is actually unhealthy and we are that control-trial yeah 
I'm I I I completely agree I mean it's yeah that that it's 
it's so-different when you're talking about a mouse in a 
cage that's sedentary and not-act physically active and 
it's so hard to compare that sort of study to a-physically 
active person you know as well but that brings us back 
to-requirements I mean what are your real requirements 
because P pure on-definition if they tell me like look um 
what will happen if I eat 25 25% less-energy than I need 
then you-die but people become healthier when they eat 25% 
less but that's something-else that is they they it's not 
that they eating 25% less than they need-they're eating 25% 
less than what they actually used to consuming and there's 
a-huge difference between those two and that's what we 
often of course don't-want to see because that makes our 
life more difficult right their baselines are-different um 
talking about resistance training adaptations you know this 
is-another area that you've done a a lot of research in can 
you tell people a little-bit about muscle memory and how 
the muscle adapts to repeated bouts of-resistance training 
yeah so the so the idea is that-every exercise training 
induces stimulation of muscle protein synthesis-and 
breakdown so you recondition the muscle to become a better 
athlete in the-next session and next session and next 
session of course the additional value-of each session 
becomes less because we we can't keep improving so there is 
a-leveling off of that adaptation now um that's in short 
what-training is that every individual bout sets off this 
this Remodeling and the-remodeling becomes more efficient 
over time and you become a better athlete now-the muscle 
memory is an interesting one because then uh now people 
suggest like-okay you haven't done anything for 10 years 
and then you start exercising and-then somebody that 
actually was a very good athlete builds up and becomes 
a-much more rapidly increases this his his his condition 
again while the other one-doesn't get the same gains now is 
that muscle memory and if there is such a-thing as muscle 
memory where is it residing now that's difficult 
because-then you actually there's a lot of explanations one 
it could be genetics-that that person was already more 
active in the past because he was more prone to-being a 
better athlete that's a possibility secondly that there's 
also-something neuromuscular that somebody picks up the 
exercise much easier and-then gets B bigger gains it could 
be um genetics uh but then uh then uh yeah-genetics on 
metalation of different proteins um and it could also be 
and-that's that's what they're now discussing and and Tim 
sniders in our-lab is actually doing a lot on that topic is 
seeing whether the number of-nuclei in the muscle are U 
maintain pain to be increased so it's easier for the-muscle 
to adapt to exercise uh now there's some rodent data-to 
suggest that we don't find evidence for that in human 
muscle so that you-basically have more managers in in in 
your in your muscle fibers that when you-put a greater 
stress on it's more easily managed so but so far we haven't 
seen-that so so generally we've seen that the myonuclear 
content and a myclear domain-actually nicely follows 
exercise training and it's not like it's-completely 
different from somebody that actually did a lot of exercise 
in 20-years ago now you've also done some some been 
involved in some research looking-at exercise frequency and 
I mean I presumably recovery is part of that that-equation 
uh in terms of if you're frequently working out and 
doing-resistance training is there a diminishing returns in 
terms of gaining-muscle mass is there a frequency that can 
be done to maximize muscle growth-and also recovery yes uh 
likely uh of course you would like to get the full-recovery 
and then the next training session so you optimize 
the-reconditioning process and what you do notice I mean um 
depends on how young-you are what training stage you you 
are in if I mean I haven't seen a gym in in-in last week 
but before that in in a year or two or something like that 
and-then you go to a gym and then you really notice that 
you need actually three days-before you can actually get 
your next session in when you're really in it you-actually 
train every day so it depends on your training State your 
age uh your-genetics what is your your ideal version the 
only way to figure that one out is-just try it there's no 
there's no one one rule to actually suggest that this-is it 
in terms of recovery like how like if you're working you 
know certain-muscle groups is it good to like wait 24 hours 
48 hours is there is that still-like a more of a 
personalized sort of sliding scale or personal it 
is-personalized but of course you can increase your uh your 
session intensity-by um focusing on a specific group or 
upper body lower body or or antagonist-and Agonist or 
something like that so you can exercise more frequently 
and-have enough sufficient recovery time for each specific 
body part that's a way-that that that atlet use it to 
optimize recovery and maintain a high training-load there 
are you you've published a study looking at an aging 
population so-you did elderly but also so you did older 
adults and then also elderly so-these are people like 85 
years old and and you show they could have-improvements in 
muscle mass and strength after engaging in a resistance 
training-program if there are some people out there who are 
you know older adults and-elderly who perhaps want to start 
a resistance training program are any sort-of exercises 
that you think might be um just you know beneficial to 
start with-for improvements in muscle mass and strength so 
the first thing to say is-that the turnover of muscle so 
the breakdown and the synthesis of muscle is-something that 
occurs at 1 to 2% per day as we started off this this this 
this-podcast with and that is independent of age so also 
when you're 85 you still-have on a daily basis your making 
muscle and your breaking down muscle and the-only way to 
maintain it or increase it is to do exercise now the level 
of-exercise depends on where you are at so if you're 
actually quite sedentary and-you have a lot of issues and 
you have difficulty getting up from the toilet-then it 
might be more sense make more sense to basically have two 
or three-sessions a day where you try to get up from the 
toilet three times simply on-your own toilet in your own 
environment prefer with somebody to to-to see that you're 
not falling whereas there's also very very fit elderly 
that-will actually pick up resistance exercise and go to a 
gym three times a-week so nowadays with uh healthy aging 
it's very difficult to give advice-because the variation 
that we see in the elderly I we now are supposed to call 
it-the older population is huge if we I mean in the past we 
got hip and knee-surgery for people that were so in pain 
that they just wanted to have the pain-to stop now we have 
old the people coming in from new hips and new knees to-go 
to go skiing with the grandchild so the targets set by the 
older population-can be from staying in their own home 
being able to go to the toilet uh-unsupported and therefore 
not being institutionalized to 85 year olds that-still want 
to do an Iron Man so of course the training has to fit with 
the-targets being set and where they start off from yeah 
that makes sense I have a-question regarding women and 
their response to adaptations from resistance-training 
either premenopausal versus postmenopausal or 
postmenopausal with or-without hormone replacement therapy 
so in other words the-how the adaptations change with you 
know estrogen and progesterone and-testosterone more more 
more hormones around y um so as we get older and we-get uh 
hormone dis disbalances then people feel differences but 
the efficacy-by which training increases muscle mass and 
muscle strength and muscle-conditioning doesn't seem to 
have a huge impact there so far I mean this is not-my topic 
with uh with but but most of the studies with pre uh and 
post wom-menopausal women I believe and even with and 
without uh supplementation we see-hardly any studies that 
I've seen don't show any differences now we have a lot-of 
experience with prostate cancer patients so we've actually 
had a lot of-prostate cancer patients on ADT so the first 
thing that happens when they are-being diagnosed with 
metastatic prostate cancer is that they get 
enogen-deficiency therapy so basically they get chemically 
castrated so that the-testosterone will be gone down just 
completely nump um these people-generally uh gain fat Mass 
lose muscle mass and are at an heightened risk for-card 
cardiovascular disease and often develop also insulin 
resistance and-diabetes now we thought like hey how easy is 
it to uh increase or prevent the-muscle loss to some extent 
we were we were modest in this with uh only like-two 
resistance exercise sessions a week we increased muscle 
mass we-increased strength control group went down there 
was no loss there was-actually an increase in muscle mass 
there was an increase in in muscle-strength so the hormones 
do not I'm not saying that the hormones-don't play a role 
because hypogonadal men of course in general have 
less-muscle but exercise can fully overcome the effects of 
hormonal changes exercise-is much stronger than that yeah 
it's it's just it's so powerful it is I mean-we we had a 
lot of um so we worked of course with with with the 
department and-and we work with dialysis patients and we 
work with prostate cancer patients-and we've see it every 
time and everybody just says like why do do do-don't we 
just put this in our uven therapy like you can go on ADT 
but ADT-always goes together with resistance training you 
have I mean the ADT is life-saving but then all the 
negative effects of the ADT can be completely 
fully-overcome with resistance exercise that's ridiculous 
right why do we still have-those side effects if they're 
not necessary so testosterone does play a-role in the 
context of these people that are not physically active and 
and then-they start to lose more muscle but you can you can 
you can basically attenuate-that if you are you can't to 
even attenuate so you can actually increase-muscle mass and 
strength right so so it's it's greatly OV exaggerated 
that-the the hormonal changes can be overcome with 
resistance exercise that's the most-important message there 
there's a St a saying that um our mutual friend 
Stu-Phillips says and I really like this saying is that 
exercise forgives a lot-of sins and I'm seeing that 
recurring theme in you know not just exercise-physiology 
but in other fields as well I mean it's just sleep sleep 
deprivation-being one I mean insulin resistance goes up 
glucose disregulation homeostasis you-know out of control 
but you know doing exercise mostly can can rescue a lot 
of-that even all cause mortality increases again physical 
activity really can-forgive some of those some of those 
sins so it's really you know it's the best-medicine even if 
it's not sense I mean even if it's disease it can have so 
many-benefits um yeah I also think looking at it like I 
just called it a medicine but-you know yes exercise is a 
treatment and that's like a a a general saying you-hear 
people say exercise is a good medicine but honestly I 
think-sedentarism is a disease it's I was just about to say 
this is this comes exactly-back to the nutrition that we 
said like it's not excess carbohydrates not it's-not a high 
carbohydrate diet it's not a high protein diet it's not a 
high fat-diet it's excess and so uh and we talked about 
the-animals over feeding and that the control group is 
actually an unhealthy-group we are unhealthy because we're 
not exercising enough we are actually-redeveloped where we 
actually needed the physical activity in order to stay 
alive-to forage of our Foods and to hunt and stuff like 
that and so it's not that-maybe it's not the exercise is 
actually the benefit it's actually reducing our-exactly 
what you're saying reducing our inactivity it's a disease I 
think you-know obesity is a disease type diabetes 
occational Hazard sedentarism is a-disease it's right I 
mean so um I do want to kind of shift gears because 
cold-water immersion is an area that you have done research 
in and I'm personally-interested in the neuroendocrine 
effects of cold water immersion a lot of-Physically Active 
people are interested in using cold water immersion 
for-recovery for enhancing um sorry for blunting 
inflammation of the muscle but-you've shown and maybe you 
can talk about your study about you know doing-cold water 
immersion immediately after resistance training can blend 
some gains-do you think the timing of cold water immersion 
can affect you know whether or-not you're going to blunt 
those gains because you want you want to keep doing-those 
cold showers yes I'm doing those as well so um so yeah I 
mean I think I-mean with looking at heart rate variability 
and stuff like that I mean-I've been experimenting with 
that myself as well with the C Showers and the the-ice bath 
and but of course uh from a muscle perspective um nothing 
makes-sense on recovery after exercise that cold would 
actually be helpful so um we-did a study where we used the 
intrinsic labeled protein so we could track where-the 
protein goes uh acutely but also more longterm and after 
exercise we put-One lag in cold water and one in Thon 
neutral water and we saw that the lag in-the cold water did 
not get the same stimulation of muscle protein 
synthesis-and basically less of the protein would actually 
go to the lag less profusion-less stimulation of muscle 
protein synthesis so from at least for the first-6 hours it 
seems evident that acute recovery recovery in the light of 
muscle-protein synthesis glycogen restoration is-actually 
compromised by the by the lower temperature part of that is 
that because-you inhibit perfusion but also of course all 
the enzyme and all the process-activity in the muscle is 
also reduced by a lower temperature because that-that's 
just what happens I was surprised that uh I-thought like 
hey maybe then you compromise that acute recovery phase 
but-then you maybe catch up later on when you warm up so 
that if you do this over-two weeks it doesn't make any 
difference so we continue doing that for if I'm not-not 
incorrect over two weeks with six training sessions and so 
it's six-training sessions we've only up to about 15 
minutes of cooling I thought that-could never have an 
effect over those full two weeks and if there's an 
effect-we wouldn't be able to pick it up but we did and 
over those two weeks total-protein synthesis in that lag 
that received cooling compared to the other-was actually 
less and actually measurable less so that six times 
15-minutes cooling over two weeks 14 days 24 hours had a 
negative-impact on the stimulation of muscle protein 
synthesis my only conclusion is-is that the reconditioning 
is therefore not optimal-now if you still want to do the 
cooling now the shower is only short but would-it be uh 
good to do it at different times I think so um why is 
everybody-then still doing the uh the cold water immersion 
after exercise I think it came-from from Sports where you 
basically hurt the muscle where there's 
massive-inflammation where there's uh blunt force trauma on 
the muscle that actually-you you you basically support the 
muscle in recovery not recover not the-reconditioning but 
basically minimize the damage and then-people started using 
it for other sports as well but I think for 
resistance-training or for uh andu training it's you 
shouldn't be using it at least not-acutely after the 
exercise session and you said something that I picked up 
on-you said for 6 hours do you think that if you do cold 
water immersion and you-wait 6 hours after resist distance 
training that you would uh still affect-muscle protein 
synthesis I mean pure speculation I think it would be less 
um-so um but then the other question is then uh for your um 
um your other-benefits whatever they are of course there's 
also a lot of discussions on-that do you need to do that 15 
15 minutes um is it better to do it the-other day um at 
least the first few hours I think-are essential for the 
muscle I would stay away from the cold there is it okay-to 
do it then in the evening or the next day I would favor 
that as opposed to the-other one MH SO waiting for Recovery 
days now you mentioned endurance-training but um you know 
there are studies showing that cold water-immersion can 
enhance performance and endurance trainers and also 
enhance-neuromuscular function you're talking about that 
probably not as these people-aren't you know you know they 
the the resistance training is really-stimulating muscle so 
I'm wondering if you could do it perhaps on an 
endurance-training day maybe wait a few hours again um I I 
think we would have found-exactly the same thing if we had 
done endurance training uh so this was-resistance training 
uh I think if we had done endurance training you would 
also-have less of your amino acids that you ingest go to 
the muscle I mean a lot-less of all this kind of work has 
been done after in jun's training but it-seems to follow 
all the same principles it's just a different sets of 
proteins-that are being expressed to a greater or lesser 
extent after endurance versus-resistance exercise but 
they're also responsive to nutrition and so they-should 
also be responsive to blood flow to the muscle so I think 
it doesn't make-a difference for endurance or resistance 
type exercise the studies that I've seen-is they either 
show no effect and if they show effect it studies where 
that's-not inurance exercise it's actually high-intensity 
intermittent type-exercise where there's also a huge damage 
if effect and inflammation and I-think there it can have a 
benefit to D dampen that down and then acute-performance 
afterwards is less compromised but that's something 
else-than optimizing your training reconditioning right 
yeah so you're-you're talking more at the elite level where 
they're really like the rowers or-the you know these these 
Runners that are that are you know they're incurring-more 
damage on their muscle um so if the the cold water 
immersion is causing Vaso-constriction it's it's preventing 
the muscle profusion right um the question-is how long does 
that last so the norepinephrine is the hormone that 
is-regulating that as you know and that does go up even 
after just you know 2-minutes in cold so the question then 
goes well uh well how long does that-last so like you know 
is it an eight hour response do you think it would be-eight 
hours that it's it's going to be affecting I have no idea 
um in this case-I mean temperature at least skin 
temperature was already quite normal-quite fast but the 
response over over over 6 hours was still visible so uh 
I-mean these studies are hard to do because then if you 
actually would do it-this way I would like to take a biopsy 
at 2 4 6 8 12 14 16 18 22 and 24 hours-and of course nobody 
wants to participate not even the older subjects-in our 
studies are going to sign up for that or at the very least 
it would be-interesting to do a cold water immersion where 
it's not immediately after-resistance training it's you 
know oh yeah I mean that's that would be great8-hours maybe 
the next day if we would do that two- week intervention 
study where-you actually have the three sessions and the 
and the the no the six training-sessions and you have the 
six cooling sessions and then you have the six-cooling 
sessions on the days that you don't have the training so 
you have-three treatments um six training sessions with 
cooling six sessions with-cooling on the other day and only 
the six uh six training without the cooling-um yeah that's 
a huge study but I mean I'll be interested to see what 
comes out-after two weeks yeah I guess I guess the question 
is is that you-know if you if you're if you're doing 
resistance training and you wait 6 to-eight hours after 
that training will that cold water immersion-blunt your 
gains you said maybe a little bit maybe not um it will 
likely be less-if you do it on the the opposite day so SO 
waiting just on a recovery day is is-what you think is best 
okay but I mean you I mean that's the whole thing we-always 
focus on muscle but everything has to be optimal I mean 
it's the same-as oh you can take creatine and you you get 
stronger legs and you have have a-higher workload but then 
if you're a high jumper and you gain 1.2 kilos-simply also 
by most of it actually water retention you it's not going 
to improve-your high jumping so it's more than only muscle 
of course-of course yeah um I I want to shift gears and 
talk about collagen last um-because you've also been 
getting involved in some of this research and-I'm I'm very 
you know interested in in hydrolyzed collagen powder for 
skin for-example and skin aging and so I wanted to ask you 
if you think there are-effects on supplemental hydrolyzed 
collagen powder that are independent of-the muscle 
connective protein which I think if I'm correct does not 
have a-huge amount of collagen but do you think there are 
effects in maybe other tissues-like the joints skin for 
example bone that's a lot of-questions um so collagen is 
nowadays is much seen as a potential supplement to-support 
muscle conditioning and of course we were interested from 
that-perspective um we often look at uh myi protein which 
is the contract-contractile protein in the muscle of course 
because that's that's what what-generates the force but you 
have to understand that the force that is-generated by the 
contractile proteins has to be transferred towards 
your-tendon and your bone in order to make movement 
possible and so the muscle has-an all intricate network of 
connective proteins that allow the the connect the-the 
contractile apparatus to be transferred to throughout the 
whole-muscle in both longital as well as transversal way 
towards the tendon and-the bone and there's now suggestions 
that strength is very much dependent on-the quality of that 
connective uh protein Network and in muscle that is um-a 
lot of it is collagen uh but if we get a a fraction of the 
muscle is the-connective connective proteins and of those 
connective proteins about 5% is-collagen and so we were 
interested to see collagen ingestion will 
actually-stimulate that specific fraction in muscle now so 
far um Studies have not-shown increase in muscle protein 
synthesis when you ingest collagen now-why could that be 
the case because it responds to high quality protein but 
not-to collagen now collagen is is from a from amino acid 
composition not a very-high quality protein because almost 
50% is composed of uh of Proline and glycine-and so it has 
a lot less essential amino acids and so if you give 
collagen-protein you generally don't see increase in mixed 
muscle proteins we've done a-study to see whether it 
increases connective protein in muscle we don't-see it at 
least not with the with the the 20 grams or or the 30 
gr-amounts um why would it work or why would it have an 
effect because the-suggestion is and that's the story 
behind it there's actually two stories-one is that collagen 
has a lot of glycine and Proline and of course-collagen is 
composed in your body also a lot of glycine and Proline and 
maybe-does not a love of those amino acids in our uh in our 
Foods in our nutrition but-of course um it doesn't matter 
that it actually increases muscle protein-synthesis so now 
we've tried it now like three studies and so far we have 
not-shown evidence that collagen increases connective 
tissue protein synthesis in-muscle but yeah I have to admit 
that the muscle fraction is only very small-amount of 
collagen so what about other tissues cartilage bone tendons 
ligaments-which is more than 80% collagen maybe there it's 
more relevant and maybe even-more relevant when you had 
surgery and you basically yourself you have to-reattach 
everything you have to renew all those collagen structures 
maybe-there it is a benefit now there's also people 
suggesting that in collagen and-especially hydrolized 
collagen there's functional or U peptides that 
are-bioactive bioactive peptides so far um we haven't seen 
anything of that and-there's always discussions like what 
are those peptides then um haven't seen any-any data to 
convince me yet and of course it is not that the amino 
acids in-collagen are not being used we used intrinsic 
label protein for example also-to show that the glycine or 
that the amino acids actually show up in collagen-so yes 
collagen can be used and is a good source of glycine and 
Prine but-does it further increase connective protein 
synthesis when compared to a-high quality Dairy protein or 
a different-protein so far we haven't seen any evidence for 
that but of course again-it's just a matter of the amount 
if you give twice the amount of-collagen uh which has the 
same essential amino acids than half the amount of 
for-example egg or dairy protein you might actually see 
exactly the same response-but there's a lot of studies that 
still need to be done to figure this one out-it's 
interesting there's been a lot of people that think that 
hydrolyzed-collagen powder doesn't actually go to cartilage 
but there's been some animal-studies that have radiol 
labeled hydrolyzed collagen powder and it does-go to 
cartilage do you think that's applicable like that's 
translatable to-humans so the amino acids I mean so like I 
said collagen contain contains uh like-any other protein a 
lot of lot of lot of amino acids and particularly the 
amino-acids Glycine and Proline and of course those amino 
acids are going to be used-to synthesize proteins whether 
that's connective protein or whether that's-that's that's 
my fi protein so yes I mean this is just a protein source 
which-has a lot of glycine and protein so yeah why not why 
not but from a complete-Constitution it doesn't have as 
much as a balanced amino acid prot as most-animal are 
higher quality animal derived proteins um but that doesn't 
mean that I-mean I think I mean this is something that I 
think we we we so in muscle I-think that the availability 
of the amino acids is not restricting the increase-after uh 
physical activity because after physical activity we see 
the connective-tissue protein synthesis rates go up but it 
doesn't seem to be depend on the-amount of protein or 
collagen that you provide so I think there it's not-limited 
at least not in the first few hours after exercise maybe in 
a longer-time frame I don't know that's possibility I think 
uh the the greater-benefits are to be expected if they are 
there on the the tissues that have a-higher collagen 
content and so I think there's still um a wind of 
opportunity-there as a good source of glycine and Proline 
for recover restoration or-repair of collagen rid tissues 
which could be skin which could be-tendon cartilage bone 
Etc whether it is of Greater benefit than the same 
amount-of amino acids provided by other protein sources I 
don't know but that's all-stuff that we start we should 
start doing in the future um and we are-actually doing a 
few of those studies and we finished a few studies also 
where-we actually looked at skin um because skin is still 
easy to take samples from-the other ones we can only do 
that pre-surgery so we actually take people-that get a new 
knee and then we actually do the intervention prior to 
surgery but-of course with skin we can take a skin biopsy 
and we can take a muscle biopsy-repeatedly over a few hours 
and that's s of stuff that we've done but we still-need to 
analyze everything so um what about the role uh the 
signning we've-been talking you've been talking a lot about 
Proline hydroxyproline glycine I-mean these are amino acids 
that are certainly in Greater quantity in-something like 
hydrolized collagen powder versus you know a protein 
source-of food from food or even a protein powder but 
there's there's been a lot of-um at least a lot of 
preclinical evidence looking at these small peptides-being 
signaling molecules in you know their tissues and there's 
been a lot of-um sort of I I would say speculation that 
perhaps the signaling role of these-collagen peptides may 
be as important if not more important than 
the-incorporation of of Proline and hydroxyproline and 
gline um into tendons-and you know skin so that's that's 
that's that's of interest and of course-um it's really 
difficult to figure out in aivo in humans whether this is 
really-um happening because first of all what dietry or 
oligopeptides are you looking-for and then uh with having 
20 different amino acids you can almost have an an 
an-enormous amount of different Di and tri and and 
oligopeptides and even if you-measure them in the 
circulation do they actually come from the protein that 
you-ingested or were they newly synthesized in the liver so 
it's so difficult-figuring that one out but um it's it's 
it's really funny that um I was in a-podcast where somebody 
said like how do you get along with Professor bar from 
UC-Davis who actually does a lot of this inv vitro work and 
and so he must be-your your your your greatest enemy and I 
said do you want me to pick him to to-get him and then the 
guy was completely just just surprised and he said 
like-like what do you mean said he's in my office next door 
he's on the sabatical-here and so actually during the 
podcast actually got Keith out and we sat-together and then 
he thought that we had completely opposite uh perspectives 
and-we don't I mean I'm a human physiologist and and he is 
also a physiologist but he-looks at a lot of also ligaments 
engineered ligaments and looks at what-happens there but 
then the translation is to what extent can you actually 
um-Translate this to supplement use or stimulation in Vivo 
that we're still far-from far from that but yes uh the 
individual amino acids are important-whether there's 
bioactive peptides I don't really see any evidence yet um 
so-yeah the thing that really piqu my interest in that was 
um there have been-there's been a few studies looking at 
like very small amounts of hydr-hydrolized collagen powder 
I mean amounts that you would get in a pill in-people with 
giving them either the hydrolized collagen powder or a 
placebo-in people with arthritis and the very very small 
amount of hydrolized collagen-powder was having an effect 
on reducing um you know some of their a lot of 
it's-subjective but there was also some inflammation that 
was reduced and I was-thinking I'm certainly not an expert 
on that topic but I've seen a lot of those-papers and a few 
me analysis and there seems to be going some going 
on-something on pain perception but of course pain 
perception is also the-something very subjective so is it 
is it working through the guts is it working-through maybe 
gut brain AIS or is it really something between gut and 
muscle-or gut and muscular scal tissues I don't know um but 
yeah I mean My outcome-parameters are generally not pain 
that's why I brought up the uh signaling-molecule as well 
because it's like when when I saw the doses and you know 
and-these are Placebo controlled it was very surprising to 
me and like well that's a-like it's got to be something 
else going on yeah I mean we're going to we're-giving like 
like 20 or 30 grams of uh of of protein and then it's if 
half of it-is glycine and protein those are huge amounts 
the last thing about the-hydrolized collagen powder um I 
wanted to talk about was it getting your-thoughts on you 
know so typically you can hydrolized collagen-powder is is 
you know available in a wide variety of um sizes so 
anywhere-between two kodon to 10 and there's some 
evidence-that suggest perhaps that smaller like two to five 
uh kilodaltons those-peptides are better absorbed um better 
used as signaling molecules getting to-the tissues better 
um like for example skin getting you know smaller ones 
like-two to three kilodaltons I mean again there there's 
not an overwhelming amount-of evidence on this it's it's 
really upand coming and I think in its infancy-but I just 
wanted to get your thoughts any speculation as to why 
smaller-perhaps not the 10 kodon but you maybe you know the 
2 to five range might be so-quantitatively most of the of 
the protein will be completely uh digested-and absorbed as 
amino acids over the intestinal wall then released in 
the-portal vein then actually uh released via the liver 
into the circulation now-there there are Transporters for 
uh for small peptides in the guts and so they-have been uh 
yeah recognized and shown the question is do they then on 
the-other side do they stay in the intestinal cells do they 
are they-released on the other side towards the portal vein 
we don't really know that-and then what happens in the 
liver with them um so there there are some some-some some 
evaluations of of oligopeptides in the circulation are-they 
directly coming from the ingested protein or the hydrolyzed 
protein is-there a difference in their amount whether you 
have a further hydrolized-coll collagen protein with with 
smaller compounds and we don't know I mean in-fivo I 
wouldn't would wouldn't have the guts to say it and what 
are your-thoughts on the skin studies that's that's one 
area where again like you-mentioned tissues with a lot of 
collagen might be more important so sometimes-people don't 
realize how little we know because uh we know that if you 
provide-protein and you see an increase in circulating 
amino acids you see muscle-protein synthes increase and I 
still think that's-magical I mean I'm a complete nerd of 
course that I'm saying that but do-realize that you 
constantly have amino acids being released from the 
turnover I-told you that all those other tissues have a 
huge turnover much higher in the-muscle so there's 
constantly free amino acids being thrown in your 
circulation-very rapidly and then you only give like 20 
g-of protein of which 10 G is released in the circulation 
over the next four hours-and that is only only a spark like 
maybe 15% on the total turnover the release of-amino acid 
in circulation and that sets off a process that makes the 
muscle-start synthesizing muscle Protein that's remarkable 
because it's not a huge-increase it's on the top of 
everything it's only little stimulus now we know-this from 
muscle we know how it works we know what it does and now we 
have the-signaling molecules the signaling Pathways we know 
the mtor we know Lucine-etc etc we don't know anything 
about all these other tissues so do the other-tissues 
respond to nutrition or not and that includes skin but it 
also includes-the liver and the Heart whatever so the big 
question is do these tissues respond-to protein ingestion 
by greater muscle protein synthesis or are they just-having 
the same turnover but they use of course the amino acids 
that are being-released by the by the protein in our diet 
so that's the big question now for-skin it's interesting 
because we can figure that out because I can't take-three 
samples of the of the liver or the lung or the or the brain 
in in 6 hours-that's impossible I can maybe obtain one 
sample after like a 2hour surgery for-the skin of course we 
could actually do the same thing as a muscle and now 
I'm-not uh that much interested in skin but if skin is 
actually an easier way of-finding the investigating the 
same process as muscle that's interesting-because then we 
only have to get take skin biopsies which is much easier 
on-think muscle biopsies um so I'm really interested to-see 
what comes out of that study well the other interesting 
thing too would go-back to that signaling role because 
again I've seen and this is as you-mentioned largely in 
vitro when scientists are looking at mechanistic-potential 
explanations um is that you know these these these collagen 
peptides-that are that are small they do they're they're 
decreasing Matrix metall-proteinases that are breaking down 
collagen they're increasing-enzymes that are synthesizing 
collagen in the skin like these are in you know-are skin 
cells fiber blast but but the big question is I mean so 
we've seen-people I mean there's people doing initro work 
with all kinds of compounds-throwing them in the dish and 
so seeing something happening but does the muscle-see those 
compounds that's one and in what concentration absolutely 
and that's-where it's it's limited so a lot of that 
research has not been done and to be-honest a lot of the 
the collagen research is is still still in how do you-say 
that children's shoes or baby shoes it's basically it still 
has to happen I-mean it took us many years to convince 
people to uh co- support in public-private Partnerships 
these kind of studies to see what are the benefits of-of 
collagen because I mean the story can be good but I mean we 
need to verify it-but of course it's always scary because 
what if it doesn't do anything what if-and that's that's 
always what restricts science of course because I mean 
science-is costly but I think the studies just need to 
be-done it do you think there might be beneficial um 
aspects to-consuming a a type of what you in some ways 
called Low low protein um Source-because it doesn't have 
all the yeah low quality protein it doesn't have all 
the-great amino acids for um you know skeletal muscle 
protein synthesis but-you know Proline hydroxy in glycine 
it's high in arginine Arginine plays a role-in um you know 
our vascular system like do you think there could be a role 
just-for consuming hydrolized collagen power Just For Those 
amino acids that are a-little more abundant in that type of 
protein Source if there's a um an-unbalanced need for 
specific amino acids then of course a source that is 
richer-in those amino acids might be of benefit um but 
those amino acids can also be-provided by other protein 
source of course but then again it's a matter of-um you 
compensate with with greater quantity in order to get the 
same amino-acids in and so what I think and what I would 
like to do to study but we are not-doing that yet after um 
um large orthopedic surgery where the-collagen is actually 
of benefit to resynthesize all those collagen Rich-tissues 
because then knowing that 50% is glycine and protein of 
these tissues-that's a lot of glycine and protein so maybe 
in those conditions you need-sources of extra Glycine and 
protein and then uh I mean uh then you might-actually have 
a benefit of taking collagen supplements but of course 
you-could also get that by your normal nutrition but there 
are some interesting-calculations and assumptions that 
nowadays our diet is is low in for-example uh Glycine and 
protein because we're not consuming bone broth anymore-and 
stuff and a lot of our our food is processed I mean so the 
story is still-there but I mean the science is not there to 
back it up yet yeah I don't-like I don't know that most 
people are consuming high high amounts of of-Proline and 
Glycine and hydroxyproline from food sources unless they 
are eating-the cartilage of their chicken and you know 
making the bone boiling the bone-broth I mean yes some 
people are doing that but the general population is not-and 
so it is easier to take a hydrolyzed collagen powder which 
has a much higher-concentration of those specific amino 
acids than eating a steak yeah what I-often also hear I 
mean the hydroxyproline um that might have a I-mean that 
actually is increased in the circulation after ingesting um 
collagen-but the hydroxyproline is not a precursor for your 
incorporation in your-own collagen but it might have a 
stimulatory effect or signaling effect-uh but we don't know 
I mean again what does the muscle see what does those-other 
tissues see um what does the sov C the only thing that I 
mean to be honest-I mean about I think four or five years 
ago I think that we were the first to-assess the uh 
synthesis rate of all the proteins in and around the knee 
so what-we did is we infused people before they they 
underwent full knee surgery and we-measured the synthesis 
rate of muscle cartilage s sovia miniski uh the the the-ACL 
the PCL uh so everything there was really funny because 
normally we take a-muscle biopsy and then we have 150 
milligrams of muscle and we're-completely happy and then we 
have to have measure all these different things-in that 
small amount of muscle now you're standing in the surgery 
room and-you're getting a whole mixed grill I mean I'm 
getting a meniscus getting an-ACL and BCL I'm getting all 
this tissue and I can I can measure this and this-and this 
now we have a whole spectrum of all the tissues in and 
around the knee-and the synthesis rates were almost all in 
the same ballpark as muscle and I-thought that was already 
for me the first step towards nutrition and these-tissues 
because the regenerative capacity of these tissues is is 
is-higher than anticipated do you know of a role 
that-growth hormone plays in collagen synthesis in yeah so 
we know that that-um especially from abuse of course that 
that the growth hormone has a um in-combination with for 
example anabolic steroids can help you with the-connective 
tissue protein synthesis and stuff like that so uh-yeah not 
not sure whether to suggest that you have to combine it 
with-collagen peptides or anything like that yeah but I 
mean you increase growth-hormone with exercise yeah yeah 
and you also increase testosterone but like I-said I mean 
the exercise uh is much more potent than the hormonal 
changes that-you see um well thank you so much Luke 
for-this very enlightening conversation for all your 
research that you've done um-before we you know before we 
leave I'd like to ask one last question about your-personal 
routine I mean how you apply maybe some of the principles 
you've-learned through your research and others for um your 
nutrition your exercise-workout like frequency I mean what 
you aim to do perhaps what you do and what-you aim to do in 
general people ask me I always say I try not to mix work 
with uh-with private life but that's uh that's just a cop 
out no I I I ride my bike a-lot uh Holland so I'm sitting 
on the road bike a lot especially in the summer-um I don't 
have a specific I don't have specific targets um I exercise 
basically-to keep everything as healthy as possible um and 
that I can indulge-myself with more food uh and I don't get 
too fat um so I cycle maybe like four or-five times a week 
and longer rides in the summer when it's uh when the sun 
is-out I used to ride in the rain but now I don't do it 
anymore I'm getting lazy and-of course some resistance 
training but that's that's not the amount that I did-in the 
past I mean now it's maybe one or two sessions a week and 
and as I heard-from you say earlier you you mostly don't 
eat a lot during the day and then-eat eat most Year yes but 
that's not not a good thing I have to change that to 
be-honest so well thank you so much Luke for coming on the 
show and talking about-your research and um the importance 
of protein and resistance training in-muscle physiology 
thanks for having me
