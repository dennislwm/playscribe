she put her hands on my chest and started praying and she 
started pushing-I don't really feel nothing not sure what's 
supposed to happen but I don't-feel the Holy Spirit like 
leading me to have a Fallout session so she's start-pushing 
harder and harder and harder I'm like yo I don't feel the 
holy spirit in-this stop pushing me why are you pushing me 
I just knew that was not God-because hey guys this it's 
Lena welcome back to another week on our channel for-this 
week's video we wanted to share another testimony about how 
God set us-free from a spiritually abusive church we want 
to share that and also just-really discuss how important it 
is to be under the right house that truly has the-spirit of 
God so let's get into it so for those of you who kind of um 
are-familiar with our story how we even first got connected 
to this specific-church it was a non-denominational 
Christian Church in Milwaukee and it was-multiethnic as 
well yeah so we got connected to that church really 
through-following after the leader of that March who did 
that March from Milwaukee to DC-who was really in reality 
trying to form a cult and we wrote All about that in-our 
book just to kind of backtrack so after God finally put us 
out of that-really really dark and traumatic experience of 
that March when we came-back to Milwaukee we were just in a 
very very-dark season of our life where we just couldn't 
figure out why we just went-through all that and what 
exactly we just went through so when we first came-back we 
didn't even have the Revelation that it was a cult we were 
just really-wrestling and questioning God like why why did 
we have to go through all that-why did we have to be abused 
and why did we have to experience what we-experienced and 
it was during that time that's when-we started just trying 
to find a source of healing we were just 
finally-surrendering and just saying okay God we just need 
your help cuz we don't really-know what else to tap into so 
and it was really through that time that God really-started 
taking us and convicting us to get our own Bible and 
actually read the-word for ourselves and so that's when we 
started finding a lot of healing and-Revelation because it 
made sense of everything that we had went through and-so as 
we were going on that journey of deepening Our Roots in God 
we were like-okay we need to get really plugged into a 
church Community because never will I-ever go through an 
experience like that again the reason we even were led 
into-that cult was because we were not rooted in Christ at 
all we didn't have any-biblical foundation so we were 
easily LED astray we had heard about this-church prior to 
us taking that March because the leader of the cult 
was-actually interviewed at this church so we had known 
about this church for a-little bit and had watched a couple 
of their sermons online but we didn't-officially join any 
church until after we came back from the March and we 
just-remembered when we were trying to figure out okay what 
church Community plug into-we just remembered this specific 
church we were specifically looking for 
a-non-denominational and a multiethnic church and so we got 
plugged into this-church so we started just pressing more 
into this community and it was really-really positive in 
the beginning like we did start experiencing a lot of 
healing-not because it was specifically coming from this 
church but because obviously-it was God it was all God and 
we just wanted to make sure that we were-connected to the 
right people because in that Journey we were connected to 
a-whole bunch of wrong people that we should not have been 
connected to in-that state of Our Lives we were like okay 
we just need to be plugged into a-community of believers 
who will not lead us astray so we wanted to um be able 
to-serve at this church so we started plugging into their 
media team we signed-up to be on their production team and 
starting to be Faithfully committed to-uh building up the 
ministry and I guess the thing about when you're in 
a-vulnerable state a lot of times when you're just so 
desperate to find healing-and find Community to experience 
any type of redemption you'll Overlook a lot-of red flags 
so in the beginning we didn't really take too much 
thought-thought to the fact that we saw a lot of turnover 
in the church specifically a-lot of turnover in the 
production team we just thought oh maybe people are 
just-taking a step back and maybe it's our season to step 
up we were like one of-the few people that were always 
consistent in serving so even though the-teams were 
dwindling we were continuing to show up to be faithful 
because we-wanted to pretty much give back because we felt 
like God had took us and brought-us out of so much we want 
to recommit our lives like fully to him and not be-led 
astray yeah so as we were serving things were going well 
but then-eventually we did start to feel like spiritually 
drained because even though-we finally connected to this 
church we never really had like a deep-relationship with 
the pastor so that was one of our desires was to like 
actually-know who our pastors are like we're people who 
completely respect boundaries-and we weren't like expecting 
all us to be buddy buddy or anything like that but-the 
reason we bring this up is because we were at this church 
for a total of a-little over 3 years and the first two 
years that we served there we had no-real conversation with 
our pastor we didn't know them at all and the thing is-this 
church was a really small congregation like it's a 
really-tight-knit community so there was really no excuse 
for why we didn't have like a-real connection or 
relationship with the leaders because it wasn't a big 
Ministry-at all all where it was like thousands of people 
that leaders couldn't like-connect with every single person 
the reason why we also liked this church was-because it was 
a small church we really didn't want to be part of a huge 
or-massive congregation where nobody really knew each other 
we wanted that family-type of feel and so even though we 
served like we were literally directly-under the leaders 
and like communicating with getting sermon notes and things 
of-that nature we never really knew them until like our 
third year we never-really had to sit down with them to get 
to know each other on a personal level-and especially just 
coming from an experience where we were damaged 
by-leadership we also wanted to be able to know who were 
following people can talk-a good talk but we have to really 
like know who these people are we had already-made a 
mistake of not testing or doing our own research and 
looking at the-fruit of people that led us into that cult 
so we wanted to make sure okay this-is where we plug in I 
want to make sure leadership is solid so we just 
pretty-much took it on ourselves to take that initiative to 
build that relationship so-we weren't like blaming the 
pastors or anything for that lack of communication-or 
anything this was just learning how to speak up and express 
what we desired-so we didn't have a problem with initiating 
that so when we finally were-able to like put a date on the 
schedule where we had a lunch with pastor and the-pastor's 
wife so we were just really looking forward to it and super 
excited-just to just get to know each other outside of 
ministry outside of-everything just as people so as we were 
sitting over lunch they were just really-asking us like 
about the type of work we do and things of that nature and 
they-had previously known that we were part of that March 
all the way across the-country because they had followed it 
a lot of people didn't know exactly what-took place on that 
March so we also felt convicted because they had 
interviewed-him on their stage during one of their services 
during the summer of 2020 we-felt convicted to let them 
know hey this was not the leader who they thought was-a 
true man of God and we wanted just to be open and 
transparent about it and-during that time we had just began 
receiving revelation of the fact that-what we were actually 
in was a cult and we wanted to be able to let them know 
so-that they too can be careful about who they platform in 
their church and we-also just wanted some more spiritual 
understanding of the spirit of the-Antichrist cuz we have 
just began learning about it as we were reading the-Bible 
and so they were able to give us some more insight into 
that and how-there will be like multiple spirits of the 
Antichrist in the last days but-there will be ultimately 
one one ultimate Antichrist who will rise up and-draw 
people away from the truth so yeah we just wanted that for 
our own-understanding as we just continue to discuss more 
they were just really like-flattering us about how we were 
really like committed to community and really-active in the 
community and specifically when I mentioned like some of 
our-connections with some local organizations one thing 
that the-specifically the pastor's wife had expressed was 
like you know I see really-you guys as being like Bridge 
Builders and connectors that y'all can really-help our 
church and our ministry make those connections looking at 
it at the-surface there's really nothing wrong with that 
but I couldn't shake that in-my spirit that just raised 
kind of a a check in my spirit that sounds very-opportunist 
especially if this is our first interaction with one 
another and-you're already saying how you see that we can 
really be used to benefit your-ministry and the thing is we 
are not against benefiting the ministry that's-why we're 
serving as much as we serve and we are wanting community 
and-relationship and we love this church so much that we 
always would find any-opportunity to share with whoever we 
knew to check out the church because we-just love the 
mission of the church so it was never because we had an 
issue-with growing the ministry but for our first 
interaction-to be oh I see you doing this and this for us 
that's not how you want to start-off it should never be 
transactional we should know each other as people 
rather-than what we can do throughout our entire life we 
had been in so many-relationships with people who only 
valued us for what we could do rather-than us as just 
simply people especially coming from pastors we just wanted 
to be-seen as as a person not for what I can do to benefit 
you so we were just kind-of fed up with being used that 
kind of disturbed me at that time but I was like-no maybe 
I'm just still healing like let me not project my hurt on 
these pastors-cuz I love them so much so we just let that 
go I'm like never mind so we just-continued on with our 
relationship and things were like things were going-things 
were good but eventually it started to seem like they were 
just is-so concerned about growing in numbers rather than 
checking in to see if the-people that were under them were 
actually thriving or doing well so it-just seemed like just 
this rush to expand expand expand but then never-really see 
where people are like spiritually and how they're doing 
it-just ended up seeming like a competition type of thing 
where as soon as people-come in there's an expectation of 
serve right away and join the team and-obviously that's 
that is the goal of a church like you want your church to 
be-able to grow and to thrive but it should never be at the 
expense of people's-spiritual growth it's not just oh they 
got them in door check mark that was-that was all you were 
supposed to do that's the beginning of the work it's-not 
your work is completed once somebody joins it's just 
starting when people-join we noticed that but we didn't 
really put voice to it cuz I don't know-this was our our 
literal first real non-denominational Christian Church 
that-we joined we don't know necessarily how a church is 
supposed to work cu we grew-up in the Catholic church we 
knew that the church was falsey foundations and-that we 
weren't going back we don't necessarily know how church is 
supposed-to work so let me just submit to this leadership 
and they know what they're-doing we were also not the only 
ones going through that we noticed that a lot-of the other 
servant leaders in the church were going through the 
same-things I remember one time specifically there was 
another servant leader I just-remember her expressing to 
the pastor that she was just feeling like super-stretched 
and I remember the Pastor telling her pretty much like 
prophesying-and encouraging her saying I see God like 
elevating you to another level and-that's why you're being 
stretched and feeling like you're being pulled but-just 
stay encouraging keep pressing into the stretching cuz God 
is preparing you-for more cuz he's elevating you and in 
that moment I just knew immediately it-was manipulating 
this individual's love for God and love for-serving God's 
people to the point where her own needs are not being met 
and-there was no respect of the boundaries like she wasn't 
saying that she needed-to establish boundaries vocally but 
I knew deep down that's what she was-trying to express cuz 
she's saying she's being stretched and Y need-to understand 
that we just started seeing not only turnover in 
the-production team but just in the worship team as well 
like a lot of people were-leaving we just knew like a big 
part of that was because leadership is not-actually taking 
inventory of where people are spiritually who are 
serving-So eventually as time went on we ended up being the 
only people on their media-team they would have two 
Services each Sunday so we would be the only ones-running 
both Services each service and at that point we were just 
used to it-because we like I mean this is what God called 
us to hey who am I to complain-and it just got us in a 
state where we started to view God as a-Taskmaster and 
that's when you know that you're not in a good spiritual 
State-because God is not someone who just tells you to do 
this this this and that-if you don't do this then you don't 
actually love me you don't actually-follow me but if you 
know who God is he doesn't do that so that just shows 
like-whenever you're in a church that starts to make you 
feel like oh if you don't do-this and that then God doesn't 
accept you we had just gotten so used to like-whenever we 
or other people would Express the need to kind of take a 
step-back we would be convinced that if we take a break 
that we're doing the body-of Christ at this service and 
that people won't receive the Gospel if if-you stop showing 
up and yes we believe fully that as the Bible says the 
Harvest-is plentiful but the laborers are few like there 
are not a lot enough people-willing to serve and so that's 
exactly why we show up and always are Desiring-to serve but 
we also have to discern when we need to be the ones doing 
the-work or when we need to take a step back and let God do 
the work cuz at the end-of the day we're not God we have to 
trust and believe that God is in control-and it's never a 
healthy place to be in when you convince yourself or 
other-people convince you that people will not get saved if 
you don't do it that pretty-much then is taking God's place 
and your playing savior in another person's life-and that 
will always lead to being overly drained and will actually 
cause-more damage in relationship than it does any type of 
service cuz I played savior-in a lot of people's life and 
each time I did that that relationship did not end-up in a 
healthy state so I've learned the hard way play your 
position but-allow God to be God in another person's life 
and also understanding that-biblically we're called to also 
yes work hard serve well but also in the-Commandments take 
Sabbath if God created the world in-six days and took a 
Sabbath on the seventh day it's not because he got-tired 
because God never rests but he chose to to show us an 
example that this-is what I'm commanding you to do because 
I know that you need rest and that rest-is really showing 
God that we trust him to not put our trust in our own 
hands-but to still ultimately let God be God in our lives 
and that we let go God was-still working God will still 
take care of us so like we said we began feeling-very 
spiritually drained and even when we tried to express 
feeling empty-whenever we wanted to reach out for that 
support those messages would be-completely overlooked 
overlooked to the point where there would be days that-pass 
where we would get no response from at first I was just 
like they're just-busy like obviously they got family they 
got-jobs they have a Ministry like that's a lot I don't 
know how they do that I was-just like let me not be a 
burden to them and whenever you start feeling that way-know 
that that's not from God you're never a burden to God and 
especially if-your leaders are called to be Shepherds over 
your life never convince yourself-that you're being a 
burden to them cuz they're supposed to be making sure 
that-you're straight spiritually so they would Overlook 
whenever we reached out-for that support but they never 
failed to reach out to us-whenever they needed something 
when I just asked them simply like just to be-present to 
show up and just show support they ignored that message but 
like right-after that message they would send a message 
saying how they need us to-create this video or do this or 
show up here for an event and then I was just-like did you 
get my last message or it just kind of-raised a question to 
me like wait how come it's only communication when 
y'all-need something but then when I'm just simply asking 
y'all to reciprocate that-it's like I'm only valued because 
I'm doing something that brings yall benefit-but other than 
that I can just be forgotten so we knew our needs were 
not-being met and we weren't being heard but again we just 
kind of brushed that aside-and we were like let me not get 
my feelings involved cuz you know maybe I'm-just being 
emotional and I don't want to sound needy or anything so 
let me just-you know bury that just keep going so we just 
continued on being part of the-ministry and the pastor's 
wife started having these Tuesday night prayers and 
I-thought okay maybe this isn't my answered prayer like 
because I'm I've-been feeling drained spiritually maybe 
attending these nights will help with-that so that I can 
show up on Sundays in a better state of mind and so we 
started-going to these Tuesday prayer nights and initially 
it was fine but at the time we-didn't realized how how 
weird it was like I said this was our first 
Christian-Church that we really were attending so we didn't 
really know exactly how church-is supposed to be this was 
our first example during these prayer nights there-would 
like be the pastor prophesying over people things of that 
nature and-praying for people this was the first time we 
started like seeing the laying-on of hands we were like 
just super open to it cuz we're like oh this is-something 
new like and we are people who do believe in Deliverance 
Ministries-because that's that's what happened in the Bible 
but it was just the way it was-done there was the 
expectation that you have to fall out if you're 
being-interceded for so if you're not falling out they're 
going to make sure that you-going to fall out so 
specifically with the pastor she would pray for people 
and-lay her hands on their head or their chest and she 
would say like she senses-some type of spirit that needs to 
be cast out and so she laid her hands and-start commanding 
whatever Spirit to come out but it got to the point where 
if the-person's not falling out she she got really 
aggressive and would do it until-the person would be forced 
to be on the floor yeah so she would lay her hand on-their 
chest and you know like kind of press in a little bit but 
if like she-doesn't see them wobbling she can go harder and 
you know us being so innocent-I'm like well dang that's 
powerful until it happened to us yeah so I remember it-was 
one specific Sunday after we had finished serving on the 
production team-even though we had in there obviously for 
the entire two Services I still felt-super empty so I'm 
like no I can't leave I I need something I'm not leaving 
until-I get what I need so I was just sitting in one of the 
chairs waiting and one of-the intercessors came up to me 
and uh instead of interceding for me she led me-to the 
pastor and I didn't think too much that at the time cuz 
inwardly I was-really idolizing this pastor because she to 
me had such a strong gift of Prophecy-and I had never 
really really experienced the prophetic like that cuz-there 
were times that she did accurately prophesy over me so that 
started making-me idolize her so the intercessor came up to 
me and led me to the pastor now-looking back if you're 
called to be intercessor you should just intercede-you 
shouldn't lean anybody to a specific person if you have the 
Holy Spirit you-should be able to pray for somebody but 
that aside she led me to the pastor and-the pastor started 
praying for me and I was crying because I was feeling 
empty-she put her hands on my chest and started praying and 
she started-pushing like okay I don't really feel nothing 
not sure what's supposed to-happen but I don't feel the 
Holy Spirit like leading me to have a Fallout-session so 
she start pushing harder and harder and harder I'm like yo 
I don't-feel the holy spirit in this stop pushing me why 
are you pushing me but-she was not going to let it go so 
I'm like okay so I see I see what's going on-in order for 
this to stop in order for you to stop pushing me cuz 
getting real-uncomfortable right now I just need to fall 
over right so I'm like okay I got-it I want this to stop I 
just need to fall so that's what I did I said okay-it's not 
being led by the Holy Spirit but I'mma fall so this woman 
can stop-pushing on me so I said right on the floor like 
that and-she was just super excited she's like oh finally I 
was like towards the back like-closing down production I 
look up next thing I see I see she's on the floor I'm-like 
sis are you good like what just happened I was on the floor 
just trying-to figure out so is this what people do like do 
people just kind of fall out on-their own cuz they get 
tired of being pushed on or was it being led by the-holy 
spirit cuz I didn't feel anything that didn't do nothing 
for me and I was-just on the floor for a while and I just 
needed to just have my time with God I-was just praying for 
God to help me cuz I really thought like something 
was-wrong with me I'm like I'm part of their Church like I 
should be feeling like I'm-growing like I should be on fire 
I just needed God to lift me out of this pit-it's just 
something wrong with me it's not the church or nothing 
clearly it's-me right I'm laying on the floor and I hear my 
pastor who just pushed me on the-floor talking about me to 
other intercessors I said ain't no way like my-ears still 
work I guess usually when people fall out they supposed to 
be-taken up in the spirit they don't hear nothing no more 
but the thing was I-wasn't taken out in the spirit and she 
was talking about me talking to the-intercessors I guess 
they were just like asking her question-and trying to learn 
from her and glean from her pretty much saying a lot 
of-times people are like super resistant to Holy Spirit and 
and you need to get them-in a place where they're really 
open a lot of times if you feel resistance it's-because of 
their pride and they don't want to be want to let Holy 
Spirit in-and so you just got to break that I just knew 
that was not God-because God is not a forceful God it says 
in the word I stand at the door and-what knock when has God 
or Jesus busted through the doors-and the thing was how was 
I resistant when I I was crying out to him I wanted-him 
because I was feeling empty there was no resistance in me 
you considered-it resistance because I wouldn't fall out 
because you laid your hands on-basically the goal of you 
laying your hands on me was to make a performance-and make 
you seem powerful rather than actually meeting my needs and 
actually-allowing the actual Holy Spirit to come in so when 
I I heard her talking about-me right there I just shot up 
right there and I left out the doors I said-yep my 
encounter that I'm apparently supposed to have it's time 
for me to go-home church service is over it's time to go 
home and G is like yeah we're just-not going to do that 
anymore that's when I started really-questioning what is 
this ministry that I'm part of because I see every 
Sunday-they always have these alter calls and people come 
up and then they get SL SL-to the floor but because I 
experienced it myself I see that it's not Holy-Spirit we 
literally getting slammed to the floor by our leaders I'm 
sorry I-don't want to come every Sunday to be beat up do 
y'all got insurance or what-cuz something happened me it's 
on you so that was another red flag that we that-we noticed 
but you know we just kind of still stay because we're like 
where else-am I supposed to go I don't know any other 
Church where I can go to like this-is literally the first 
church that I was connected to and like I don't have 
any-other choice that I know of so we just continue to stay 
we're still empty but-you know at that point we were just 
used to it we're just like I'm just here now-so I still 
really love the messages and everything I'm like oh this 
message is-fire I always would be looking to like share 
what I believe God was doing in-the ministry with other 
people and in wanting other people to come join even-though 
I was spiritually dead I just felt well maybe I can maybe 
I'm not-feeling anything maybe because I got to go 
evangelize so maybe that'll fill me-up and just tell people 
to join I didn't want to acknowledge that I was dead 
in-that church so I remember one time there was a sermon 
that I felt really-connected and resonated with another 
woman that had just been speaking on-that topic so I was 
like oh I see the connection let me send this cuz she 
had-just literally been talking about this so I just sent 
it to her and we didn't-know her all too well but we do 
know that she operated a lot in the gift of-Prophecy and 
she was a prophet and we sent it to her and just as a 
friend just-to be able to discuss the message right after I 
sent it she just sent me a-message kind of sounding 
concerned she just asked if she could call me I'm like-I 
guess she just wanted it probably was just easier to talk 
about the message-over the phone I'm like cool so I answer 
the phone and she was just telling me-this there's not 
nothing necessarily wrong with the message it's just like 
I-don't know the leader or anything obviously but I just 
feel like y'all are-not in the right house and I'm like 
you're-crazy what are you talking about this guy literally 
let me here what are you-talking about don't tell me that 
lie and she just kept going on and saying not-saying like 
the message like it is what he's preaching is biblical but 
I just I-just need to be obedient to yeah like y'all are in 
the wrong house and you-guys are going to hit the ceiling 
in order for you guys cuz you guys have a-gift and in order 
for you guys to grow in your gifts you need to be under 
a-Ministry that operates in the same gifts in order for you 
to be trained up and-grow and and she basically was just 
saying like y'all shouldn't be in the-back and I was kind 
of shocked at that point because she doesn't she 
doesn't-know that we what team we serve or anything like 
that she doesn't know that-we like quite literally are in 
the back running production in the way back at-the church 
and I was just like bro that's such a prideful thing to say 
I-don't want to be in the linelight like bro I'm fine I'm 
here to serve I'm not-trying to be in front of the camera 
I'm just like and I just was convincing-myself like that's 
just that's just Pride like I'm not trying to be all up-in 
the spotlight like no I'm here to serve I can serve in 
production I don't-care and she just went on and said just 
really pray and I I just want you all to-go on a fast for 3 
days and just really asked God to see where he would want 
you-guys and to lead you to the right house and I was just 
cord you on the phone I-didn't want to go off on her and I 
was like okay I'll do that I hung up and-after that I just 
remember I just started crying to myself I said no no-way 
that's it's absolutely no way I'm in the wrong house after 
going through that-called experience and God pulled us out 
of that there's no way that I can-continue to keep being 
connected to the wrong people like that's just not 
fair-like that's just stupid like at some point God got to 
redeem me right like I-firmly believe that this was the 
place that God was trying to redeem me and-restore me 
because I really like I genuinely convinced myself that 
this was-supposed to be my Redemption place where what the 
enemy meant for evil God was-turning for good so because 
this was the place where the spirit of the Antichrist-where 
that leader showed up and platformed himself and led me 
astray-this would be the very place that God would redeem 
me and Lead Me In Truth and-so I was really trying to make 
that a reality because that leader was here I-want this 
place to be where I'm restored a few hours later I 
collected myself and-I I messaged the lady and I was like 
hey I just want to let you know like I don't-I'm not no 
hard feelings or anything but I don't believe you hear from 
God and I-I was just transparent like your message kind of 
made me cry cuz I don't believe-God would continue to keep 
me going through these type of cycles and being-connected 
to wrong places and counterfeits like I haven't-experienced 
anything but good here even though I was lying to myself I 
just-didn't want to admit it because the reality was I 
idolized this church I-idolized the pastors I idolized this 
ministry I literally overlooked every-single red flag 
because I love this church so much both of us went 
through-several months of having to be utterly drained for 
us to finally listen we-stayed there after we got that word 
from her we stayed there stubbornly for a-whole another 
year cuz I'm like nah she liy she she a false prophet and 
and it's-the thing how you know whenever a prophet is a 
true Prophet is if they say-please take it back to God and 
she was like literally expressing her heart to-me saying 
like I'm not about that like God is going to hold me 
accountable to-giving wrong words to his people and I don't 
take that lightly like I take this-very seriously she was 
saying it was even hard for her to tell us that-because she 
knew that it would be something hard for us to to receive 
but-she had to obey God anyway so that's how you know if 
you're dealing with a real-Prophet or a false prophet is if 
if they can tell you like take it back up with-God and if 
they can still give you a message knowing that it will make 
you-feel way and you can continue to obviously test their 
fruit and also she-wasn't trying to get us to come to her 
church either so we were there for a-whole another year 
after the word and while we were serving we would-show up 
to all of their events to do their production and to film 
different-different events they would do out in the 
community and there was one specific-event where they had 
different speakers and one particular person that 
they-invited brought in some sound bows and I was like wait 
wait wait wait-wait from my understanding and me literally 
leaving New Age and I was like-wait a minute isn't sound BS 
going to invite Spirits in like I thought we were-Christian 
and so I was just watching I'm like ain't no way we as a 
church is-allowing somebody on the stage as a church event 
to have sandals in here so-that really bothered me and we 
went home and immediately we felt convicted to-reach out to 
the pastors and be like hey I'm not sure if you're aware 
but sounds-are not biblical and it's a new age practice so 
that's kind-of dangerous because God's going to hold you 
accountable for intermixing-different practices and 
especially when you're trying to build the body of-Christ 
and lead them in truth there are people who are coming here 
trying to-understand the Bible and are depending on y'all 
to teach them in their way to-go as pastors and if they see 
that y'all are platforming that type of stuff-that's going 
to make them think oh that's okay just like how you 
guys-platform that man of God that was not a man of God and 
who act in reality was-trying to build a cult because you 
guys platformed him it cost us dang near our-lives because 
we believe because you guys had him on your stage that 
means-he's legit so here we are again in another one of 
your Church events and-you guys are giving somebody the 
stage to do literal witchcraft over the-audience and it's 
going to make them think oh I can find healing in this 
God-is okay with this I'm going to go home and do this so 
so when we brought that-up to them they the pastor's wife 
immediately called us and was like hey-yeah when that was 
happening I was just like covering my ears and covering 
my-children's ears so then nothing would happen to them I'm 
like wait a minute-are you justifying what took place 
because number one you're acknowledging-that that was wrong 
number two You're just showing once again that you 
only-care about you and your own cuz you should have got up 
on that stage and put-a stop to it like oh actually we 
can't do this here but it's the fact that yall-let that 
person stay the entire event and finish what they were 
doing and what-they were doing towards the people she 
continued to justify and said you know-you know there's 
just so many things like so many new things coming up 
and-it's kind of hard to keep up you know and he didn't 
know anything and but it's-just like there's nothing in new 
age that is necessarily new it's old things-that continue 
to come up generational things that continue to come up in 
this-generation that we need to understand and know what 
the word of God says about-those type of things but let's 
just say we we give y'all the benefit of the-doubt like 
y'all didn't know that's fair let's say that's fair at the 
end of the-day you mean to tell me you didn't know what 
anybody was going to do on that-stage because at the end of 
the day your church name is on this event you are-supposed 
to vet every single individual who wants to be part of this 
a lot of-what we've seen the leadership do is to just pull 
on these big names for the-sake of having them on their 
platform because they have such a big or massive-influence 
in the city that maybe if they have it as part of your 
church that will-build your congregation once again it 
shows that-you don't actually care about people's Souls you 
want to just make yourself-look great by having all these 
people attached to you and isn't that how the-occult Works 
they provide platform as long as you sell your soul to them 
like-they'll give you the power influence and the fame and 
fortune you want as long as-you compromise standing on the 
word of God and that's exactly what was-happening because 
they didn't know what any of the speakers were going to 
talk-about or do they just knew that they were doing some 
type of activity but-it's like it's very important what 
like you should be asking as a pastor like-you should be 
asking what are you doing cuz this was a wellness event and 
you-know that always gets that always blurs the lines 
because there's a lot of-Witchcraft that does Wellness type 
of activities so we need to make sure like-the wellness 
activities they're doing are not mixing and mingling 
with-witchcraft you mean to tell me that your event you 
have no idea what's going to-happen at your event you're 
the one organizing this so I'm not like again-you're just 
deflecting and not trying to take accountability and then 
after that-phone call her husband the lead Pastor responded 
to our message about that not-being Godly and he said 
pretty much he was saying can you give me some 
evidence-that that was not godly so he had me send him 
articles about the roots and-the foundation of where sound 
balls come from and I literally sent him it comes-from 
Buddhist practices like are we Buddhist now or what are 
we-doing that's just also another form of Pride cuz like 
why you can't take it-especially if we were people who used 
to devil in New Age and God convicted us to-come out of it 
if if there's anybody you should trust it should be us 
because we-got pulled out of that stuff but it's just like 
it was just hard for him to-receive that because we were 
young but the Bible says don't let anybody make-you feel a 
certain way for being young what finally made us actually 
surrender-and actually be open and no longer be stubborn 
was when like she said we were-super super drained and it 
was just one evening when the pastor yet again-reached out 
to me to produce a project in a short amount of time at 
that point-I had produced so many other videos that he 
never actually used and I'm just like-okay now you're just 
kind of playing with me like now you're just trying to-rob 
me of my time it got to the point where we would serve so 
much I began-neglecting my own like schoolwork we were in 
college at that time and I-literally would put it to the 
side so I can devote all my time energy into-producing 
whatever projects for the church and so I was just kind of 
fed up-at that time I'm like bro you don't even use my 
work-is it not good enough for you and that was the other 
thing like the lead Pastor-would be super super nitpicky 
would not allow Holy Spirit to use my gifts he-wanted it in 
a very particular way and also would never take 
accountability-anytime it was just kind of like a 
narcissistic type of Pastor where-anything he say goes and 
if we bring anything up we're the problem so we 
were-dealing with yet another leader like that but we 
didn't want to we didn't-want to acknowledge it I'm like no 
but he serves God-yeah and so um that night when I got that 
message to produce some of the work-I just straight up told 
him in that message I just said I genu I honestly-think I 
need to take a step off of the media team I'm full-time 
student-full-time work and I just don't believe I generally 
didn't believe I could-produce God's best work continuing 
to serve the way I was serving and uh I-just expressed that 
again I was met with no response for a whole 24 hours 
until-his wife decided to reach out to me so not even him 
I'm like bro I'm talking to-you like I'm the one you're the 
one asking me and I'm the one producing work-for you why 
are you having your wife reach out to me to respond on 
your-behalf like that that was just clearly no 
accountability once again and she-just said can we like 
schedule a meeting So eventually that weekend we 
scheduled-a meeting to hop on a zoom call and they just 
wanted to understand where all this-was coming from and we 
just expressed to them like we said in the text that 
we-were just getting to a place where we were super empty 
and for our own health-purposes we need to take a step back 
because number one we're the only ones-serving on that team 
we just felt like we were just really trapped that 
we-express it on the call just like how we Express on our 
text so there was like no-confusion whatsoever after 
expressing all this the-Pastor said that an area of growth 
that we need is communication-I can I can literally pull up 
the text and read verbatim we said number one-very clearly 
but also very respectfully I the thing about me I never 
come at-nobody sideways especially when it comes to 
Authority and Leadership like I will-always respectfully 
let you know hey I just want to be honest and I truly 
honor-y'all and I respect y'all but I just need to let 
y'all know where I'm at and-you're not going to tell us 
that we're not good with communication because you-don't 
don't respond for several days when it's something you 
don't want to-hear so I start feeling like I start feeling 
that dizzy feeling I'm like oh-Lord here we go here I go 
getting gas lit again I did not dishonor y'all and-then his 
wife knew that he kind of messed up right there so she came 
in and-she was like but what she said kind of made it worse 
she said I'm not sure if-like this is if your first you 
guys first time like standing up for yourself-but when you 
when it's your first time you don't really know how to say 
the-right things I said are you gaslighting me too cuz what 
did I say what did I say-we told you clearly what's going 
on and respectfully that was my main thing I'm-like where 
where are y'all getting this from and then like they just 
completely-they just said that and I just didn't know what 
else to say and then the lead-Pastor the husband was just 
going on saying yeah we just I don't know how-this is going 
to work cuz like we need replacements for y'all and we just 
can't-have y'all step off if there's no Replacements and he 
was just like and I-don't know how like this is such a big 
part of the ministry it's gonna cause-the ministry to 
suffer because if we don't have people filming like 
that's-going to affect reaching people and at that moment I 
just couldn't hold it back-anymore I just started bursting 
into tears and I got off the camera I-literally got on the 
ground and baled myself in the corner of the room and 
I-started hyperventilating because I'm like bro ain't no 
way y'all not-listening to me and I'm talking to y'all 
respectfully I'm trying to express to-you guys you guys are 
not hearing me and it still be brought back around to 
how-it's about your ministry and how it's going to grow and 
how it's going to-affect the numbers and you just not you 
literally have a soul sitting in front-of you crying out to 
you saying they're not growing spiritually and as 
pastors-that should break your heart if somebody's under my 
tutelage and I'm a-Shepherd over them that should be should 
be a huge concern for me if people part-of my congregation 
are not growing yes I just I just told them yeah give us 
a-second I was just livid at that point to see my sister 
just going through all-that hyperventilating on the floor 
I'm like yeah it's about that time we got to-go because 
we're not going to keep putting up with this stuff and 
you-clearly don't care what's going on with this like we 
genuinely don't care so we-ended the call and he was 
bringing back to my-remembrance the word we had literally 
got a year ago saying that we need to go-and find the right 
house to be in because we're at the wrong house and-that's 
when I started actually being open to receiving that word 
and I'm like-okay Lord I'm sorry for being stubborn and 
hard-headed and not listening to you-when you told me to 
leave I'm ready now and I just need you to lead me to 
where-your spirit is cuz I don't want to be part of of 
anything that doesn't have-your spirit no more that entire 
day I was just praying heavily just trying to-seek his 
guidance and I remember that night I had one of the most 
vivid dreams-ever and it scared me it literally scared me 
out of my sleep so in this-dream it was of me and my sister 
hosting our pastors at our home and we were like-preparing 
a meal for them just to like show them honor and things of 
that-nature so my sister was in the kitchen like just 
grabbing things and I was-sitting at the table and the 
pastor and the pastor's wife was they were each-sitting on 
either side of me and I was in the center of them and so in 
the-dream they were just looking at me and it was like they 
were interrogating me-like it was scary and they 
interrogated me and they were like are we unified and-I was 
confused in the in the dream I was really confused I was 
like yes like what-are you talking about yes and I turned 
to my sister and I was just trying to-figure out what 
they're asking me that for I turned back to them as soon as 
I-turned back I my head looked down at the table and there 
was a plate right in-front of me and on that plate was the 
head of a snake and I shot up right out-of my stream and I 
was like Lord what does this mean like it's kind of 
obvious-what it means but Lord let me not be the my own 
interpreter of this dream please-lead me to what what your 
what this dream means and immediately he led me to-the part 
in Genesis is talking about even a snake and we all know 
what that-means like like Lord are you saying that they 
snakes oh my gosh see the thing-about me whenever I ask God 
anything he'll make it super clear because he-knows how 
stubborn I am like I'm like no no he's like yeah yeah so 
I'm like okay-yeah let me just start finding a place where 
people was not trying to pray on-my downfall began leading 
us and we started being open and just checking 
out-different churches and um he led us to just check out 
another church that we-had previously known about years 
prior but we had never actually attended one-of their 
service so one of the first Services what we checked out 
was an-online sermon and immediately I just felt the 
presence of God in that message-I'm like wow this is such a 
stark difference I'm going have to come see-about it in 
person to test it and so we went and when I tell you the 
atmosphere-was so refreshing I'm like wow this is how it's 
supposed to feel I have to-admit after we visited a couple 
times while still like serving at our old-church and I was 
still being stubborn like it's nice but it's not my church 
I-I still think this other church I still it was just super 
clear that that this-new church the pastor has a real heart 
for God's people like he has he has the-heart of God for 
God's people and there was no denying it like we could 
discern-that from the minute we stepped in there so I was 
like okay we're going to go and-so we had in that in the 
meantime we had already began training up somebody else-to 
replace us on the production team and when it was finally 
time to go we back-we just kind of slowly backed the way 
and it was like I think a month later-they didn't see us 
there for a while we just were just really getting 
plugged-into this other church that's so that's another 
sign that they did not care-about us cuz they didn't even 
notic we were gone so like made it easy for me-but then I 
one night the pastor's wife reached out to us like hey miss 
y'all-she kind of assumed that we were just like traveling 
and St and we had at that-time we were also figuring out do 
we say anything or do we just kind of just be-quiet about 
it so at that moment when she reached out I'm like okay 
this is-clearly God wanted me to just like be transparent 
that we were going to leave-because you know even though we 
experienced a lot of negative things-there God still wants 
us to honor where we were so I was just being cordial 
like-hey um I just wanted to take this moment to let you 
know that we believe that God-wants us to shift and 
transition from this church and um just connect with 
a-different Ministry that was other wild thing when we knew 
it was time to go the-first summon that we watched of the 
new church in the background of the church-it literally 
said the word shipped I'm not Li you so I was just telling 
her at-this moment moment we strongly feel God shifting us 
to another place and we just-really appreciate the time 
that we did have here and the times where we did-experience 
your support during that time and during that period where 
we were-able to grow but at this point we need to go 
somewhere else to continue to grow-where God wants us to 
grow and also in the message I had expressed that I 
pray-that God still is able to use them and that they would 
also be sensitive to the-needs of the people that would 
come into to their church because it's always-important to 
be sensitive to the needs of the people and not allow our 
agenda-to overtake what God wants to do in people's lives 
just just cease all-striving because it's not about our 
works it's about showing the love of God-so I sent that and 
then but her first response was really weird because it 
was-like robotic it was like hi thanks for this message 
like what the and then-right after that that's when she 
came out with like the more human emotional-response and 
she said this message actually really hurt me is there a 
way-we could schedule a meeting to talk about this in 
person because text can be-tricky like uh I said straight 
up what was happening and I'm letting you know-I'm just 
leaving we was just really mainly waiting on the lead 
Pastor to say-something but he didn't until the very next 
day and we were kind of like open-to meeting but we just 
needed to see what the head Pastor would say he-responded 
to us and said that he doesn't believe God is telling us to 
to leave-and this this is not from God and if we leave them 
we're leaving God and we're-going to stunt our our 
spiritual growth I'm like but we said we were 
going-somewhere else like it's not that we're just going to 
stop going to church-that's not what I said I said that 
this in this season we appreciated the time-that we had 
here but we're needing to grow elsewhere so it was just 
clear that-it's it's only your ministry that hears from God 
like it never has to get that-serious where you pretty much 
are condemning me because I'm finally-submitting and 
surrendering to what God wants to do in my life and 
you're-telling me that I listening to a demon you can't 
tell me what's from God-because actually I was fighting God 
on this I was not trying to leave y'all so-much to the 
point because I idolized yall so much and I did not want to 
leave-this really was not my will I had to finally 
surrender when he showed me the-fruit of the ministry so 
yeah after I got that message I'm like it's all in-your 
hands God because I'm not going to I'm not going to keep 
going back and-forth with them cuz they're never going to 
receive it I'm just going to go I'm-just going to go I try 
to leave in peace you don't respect my decision I'm 
just-going to leave it alone I forgive you even though 
you're pretty much bashing-me right now I let it go and 
then you know so several weeks later as time went-on and we 
were getting used to our new church things were going 
pretty well the-thing about us we always want to make sure 
that people know like hey we have-no bad blood for real 
like we were in a really good space during that time and-we 
were just feeling so happy to be in a place where we felt 
God's presence and-we had just let go of everything we let 
go of the hurt the pain and everything-like that and one 
afternoon I was talking to my sister like you know 
even-though we had already told them like we have nothing 
against them whatsoever we-still love them I just felt the 
need to emphasize again so I was like you know I-just 
really I really want them to know like just no hard 
feelings I'm wishing-nothing but the best for them I think 
at that point guy was kind of fed up with-me cuz he was it 
was clear that I was still I was still idolizing them 
and-still overly loving them when God said Let It Go and 
cut the soul tie that was-that was what it really was I was 
still Soul tied to this ministry and that's I-couldn't let 
it go so I was trying to come up with all these excuses to 
keep-in contact with a place where God was trying to cut 
off so but when I tell you-as soon as I picked up my phone 
to reach out the pastor's wife blew up our phone-with all 
these pictures of us with her over the years I'm like how 
like-literally and this would be a pattern too throughout 
our time in relationship-with them anytime we would start 
feeling like okay that's enough is enough we're-going to go 
we're going to leave that's when there' be this type of 
Love bombing-from the pastor's wife it it never failed 
literally it never failed it was-so crazy how it would be 
right at the moment we would talk to each other and-we were 
like we're really tired of this church we're going to leave 
right at-that split second one of them would reach out and 
say hey love you or hey-miss you I'm like hey let's get 
together we haven't got together in a while I'm-like is 
someone ease dropping on me cing me what the and yeah that 
last time-really did it because like my phone was going off 
with all these pictures-popping up I'm like yeah now this 
is just straight demonic I said yeah I-think God said don't 
he said keep that door shut do you see how they love-voming 
you they don't genuinely care for you and then they just 
they think they-can manipulate you to make you forget just 
have no sense of reality it was-just straight like a toxic 
relationship because I myself have been through a-toxic 
relationship anytime I put my foot down ready to go I said 
I'm going to-leave that's when I get love bombed just try 
to reel me back in it's just a-demonic Soul TI the weeks 
after we started attending this new church home I-had a 
second dream in this dream it was literally of us going 
like leaving from-our the church service at our new church 
and in that dream my sister was like I-want to go visit our 
old church again I was so mad in the dream but I was 
just-like okay let me just do it to make her happy so we 
were leaving from our new-church and we were like super on 
fire super filled with the Holy Spirit just-filled with his 
presence and we were leaving from that church we were 
driving-to our old church soon as I stepped in the church 
it was a whole bunch of-nonsense happening on the stage 
just different weird weird things going on-that was clearly 
not of God and I just remember being in dream and being 
so-vexed and like bro I knew we shouldn't have came back 
here I turned to my-sister like let's go we got to get out 
of here and what I tell you as soon as I-turned towards 
where the exit is I looked at the wall and when I tell 
you-there was the symbol on this wall and it was an 
Illuminati symbol I said oh my-gosh I started sprinting out 
of there I said wow now you're really showing 
the-foundations cuz clearly whenever you're in something 
you're blind to it just-like when you're in a toxic 
relationship you don't actually recognize that you're-in a 
toxic Rel you're you're so consumed with the-manipulation 
and when you love something so much your your discernment 
is not-there and you just don't acknowledge what it is and 
so when we finally-actually had left from that church 
that's what God was showing us like bro-you don't even know 
what you were in like behind the-scenes you don't know what 
they're doing so we thank God that we're not there 
any-longer so that's our story of God delivering us from a 
spiritually-manipulative church and pretty much a 
demonic-covering wow just wow anytime we share our 
testimony is so that we can help-anyone else who may be 
going through the same experience we never share oh 
just-because we want to talk about no and the thing is we 
never share until we feel-God releasing us to talk about it 
because we have been manipulated and-deceived and led 
astray so many times in our life we never want anybody else 
to-go through what we went through because if that did a 
lot of damage to us we-know how much damage it can do to 
other people and our ultimate goal is to-prevent others 
from going through the same things and we want to share 
this-testimony to share really the life lessons that we've 
learned from this so-number one we can't emphasize it 
enough but do not allow your love for people to-dilute and 
cause you to miss the red flags if you've been following 
this-channel a lot you can clearly see we have an issue 
with uh overlooking red-flags because we want to give 
people the benefit of the doubt too many times and-um we 
don't lean into the discernment and the Discerning of 
spirits that the-holy spirit gives each of us to protect us 
because we're like no we just-stubborn so when the Holy 
Spirit is giving you that check in your spirit-again don't 
ignore that's God's love that he's trying to tell you 
something-the other lesson that we learned was to obviously 
kill our Idols so similar to-the first one when you overly 
love someone or something it will turn into-an idol where 
you literally do anything to keep it in your life we have 
to kill-every Idol and only allow God to take his rightful 
place in our life so that-we can be protected from 
experiences like this and the thing about God is-he'll 
never uh help you build an idol he only destroys idols and 
uh in Exodus-34:14 he says that he's a jealous God we don't 
want to cause him to try to-destroy anything we got going 
on because he's a-jealous guy the third thing is to kill 
your pride obviously now I recognized-that at that time 
when we got received the prophetic word to leave and find 
a-place where we actually belong um had a lot of Pride I'm 
like no you I I tried-to project that on her saying that 
she's just um speaking from her own pride and-saying that 
saying that because I need to be in the Forefront that's 
just a lot-of pride no that's pride in me I had to kill 
that pride in me it says-specifically in Matthew chapter 
10:41 if you receive a prophet as one who speaks-for God 
you will be given the same reward as a prophet and if you 
receive-righteous people because of their righteousness you 
will be given reward-like theirs I was we weren't getting 
any type of reward because we were not-receiving the word 
from the prophet and we were going through a lot because 
we-were being disobedient and so that's why Always kill 
your flesh kill that pride-in you so that whenever someone 
comes with you with correction you can receive-the other 
lesson we have is to surrender your will to God so again 
like she was-saying because we were stubborn we stayed in a 
place that we were supposed-to leave a long time ago so we 
have to remember that the word of God says that-Jeremiah 29 
and11 that God knows the plans he has for us plans of good 
and-not to harm us to give us a hope in a future so when we 
can trust that he has-good plans for us when someone tells 
us that we need to transition somewhere or-if God speaks to 
you about needing to change something or let something go 
you-have to trust that whenever he tells you to let 
something go he has a plan for-why he's asking you to leave 
that and to trust that it's only for your good and-uh a 
common theme that we've been talking a lot about on this 
channel is-about false prophets and angels of light so 
people who come disguise as Believers-and people of God but 
really they have a different motive behind that disguise 
so-again just beware of angels of light and really pray to 
God to ask him to reveal-who these people are to show their 
real intentions and what kind of spirit is-operating in 
them 2 Corinthians 11:14 it says but I'm not surprised even 
Satan-disguises himself as an angel of Light so always make 
sure you're testing the-fruit of the leadership that you're 
under and in the house because uh you-never know what 
really they have going on behind the scenes and just 
always-pray that God would reveal the foundations of it cuz 
he did that when I-finally said Okay God show me and the 
last lesson from this whole video leave-when God tells you 
to leave can't emphasize that enough it's really-important 
that we be obedient to his leading and his Spirit often 
times we-will not understand why he tells us to do certain 
things but it's not for us to-understand before we do we 
are just supposed to do because he knows the-danger of us 
staying in certain places and environments that because 
he's a-good father he wants us to be in the right place and 
specifically to leave-demonic coverings we just also want 
to drive home the fact that spiritual-mothers and fathers 
are not biblical that's just a manipulation tactic to 
get-people to be overly dependent on any leadership we've 
talked about that-within the Catholic Church where people 
are overly dependent on the priests if-anybody calls you or 
you consider anybody a spiritual mother and father-just 
kind of check why like don't don't buy into this this 
man-made doctrine-that someone is your spiritual mother or 
your spiritual father and some scripture-that can back this 
up is in Matthew 23:9 it says and don't address anyone here 
on-Earth as father for only God in heaven is your father so 
don't let nobody tell-you that they're your parent that's 
just kind of weird you have obviously Earthly-parents you 
have Heavenly Father but don't let these uh Ministry people 
try-to claim you and CU we experiened a lot of that where 
people are really coveting-us to be under their covering 
like no we under God and God Alone also wanted to-highlight 
and provide another resource that talks about about these 
type of-cult-like churches um specifically in a YouTube 
live that was done by Tiffany-Montgomery and pastor Kevin 
La Ying that they recently did called The Art of War-part 
two spiritual implications of idolatry and we'll have that 
linked-below because when we watched that that did it right 
there and that just really-was confirming everything that 
we were going through when we stayed at that-other church 
and why we really need to leave we're in no way saying not 
to go-to church we're clearly at a new church we're saying 
be sure that you're within-the right church cuz it's really 
important who you're connected to and-what Ministry you're 
connected to because it always either Propel you or-hinder 
you so we appreciate you all taking the time to listen to 
our-testimony and we hope that you were able to find 
something helpful in what we-shared let us know if there's 
anything else you would like to hear more about-and we will 
see you all in the next video
