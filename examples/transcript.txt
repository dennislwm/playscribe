[Music] they want to kill us if they catch us-they're going 
to kill us watching on in horror as outside their window an 
Angry-Crowd tried to turn over a police van this is the 
moment hammed and Abdullah-not their real names thought 
they were going to die when the place they call-home was 
attacked by an Angry Crowd who tried to set it on-fire 
there is no Humanity if you understand what I mean it's 
like you-know zombie they burn they want to kill they-make 
like that they make gestures yeah just like that always and 
we're going to-cut you they make we don't cut you if we 
don't cut you today we're going to cut-you tomorrow if we 
don't cut you tomorrow we're going to cut you after-one 
weekend they was thinking we going to-die I swear I don't 
lie oh yeah they're both here seeking Asylum and showed 
me-footage that they filmed when their hotel in Ron was 
attacked by right-wing-rioters who then turned on the 
police they've been moved to a new hotel we-won't reveal 
where it is or their identity for their own safety now 
you've-been moved to a different Hotel what are you hoping 
for now we need to they leave-us alone that's it we need to 
live like everybody in this world ladies and gents-if you 
find anything you don't think you should be picking up give 
us a shout-today a community cleanup volunteers coming 
together to to say this is the-image of the real rotheram 
240 people seeking Asylum had been housed here-they've all 
been moved on now how have some of the most vulnerable come 
to be-the target of this violent unrest and crucially what 
can be done to stop it-after an emergency Cobra meeting the 
Prime Minister announced a standing army-of specialist 
officers to tackle the arrest although he didn't 
clarify-exactly what this means whatever the apparent 
motivation this is not protest-it is pure violence and we 
will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our-Muslim 
communities so uh the full force of the law will be visited 
on all those-who are identified as having Taken part in 
these-activities in Tamworth petrol bombs were thrown and 
the police attacked by people-chanting racist slogans one 
officer suffered a broken arm The Crow then set-fire to 
this hotel as inside Asylum Seekers and the staff feared 
for their-lives the hotel had previously been identified by 
the local MP who said in a-Commons debate people want their 
hotel back today Sarah Edwards said in a-letter she condemn 
the violence they're just fixing up the windows and 
assessing-the damage here many have been left wondering not 
if there will be another-attack but where after a weekend 
in which violent disorder has swept across-the country 
country there are many wider questions about racism and 
islamophobia-about the power of social media but also the 
responsibility of politicians some-of whom have been 
accused of using inflammatory language which is 
then-co-opted by extremists so these cameras 
provide-reassurance for the sort of the the congregation 
and they're sort of at the-front and back end of the 
entrance so these security at her mosque in-Birmingham ham 
Muhammad shows me the security measures they have Place 
rumors-have been circulating on social media channels that 
far right groups are-heading to this city it's very much 
rumors at the moment but it feels like a-very very real to 
us as a community here because we have to sort of really 
make-ourselves less panicked ham says many black and Asian 
communities have been-left fearful but also angry at those 
who question their right to call themselves-British she 
feels there needs to be a wider debate about the causes of 
the-violence to be sort of told you are not British and you 
do not belong here it's-sort of like then where do I belong 
I clearly can't go somewhere else and I-clearly don't 
belong here and that must make you feel horrible when 
your-identity is being questioned as a as a British person 
I think the wider issue-is that scapegoating of Muslims of 
migrants of people of color that we've-seen decades and 
time and time again in the news where migrants are referred 
to-as illegal immigrants or fire right thugs are sort of 
class as just just-protesters rather than what they really 
are which is um racist islamophobic-riots 6 days since the 
unrest began there have been nearly 400 arrests-across 
England the suspects have started to appear in court the 
Prime Minister-insists they will feel the full force of the 
law for their actions but addressing-the reasons behind 
their actions and stopping its spreading will be 
much-harder well right now Dashner is in Alam Rock in 
Birmingham where there have been-rumors online since this 
morning of another farri right Gathering Dasa-what's 
happening there now all day rumors have been 
circulating-that farri groups will be coming here next to 
this community in the distance-you might be able to hear 
police cars going by there are groups of young men-some say 
they are on the way to a roundabout nearby where around 200 
or so-have gathered they said to me that they are from this 
community some of them are-from the local mosques they say 
that they are already to defend their-community and when I 
asked them what this would mean they said they don't-want 
any trouble but they will meet force with Force those are 
the words-that some young men used tensions are very high 
here we've spoken to-immigration advice centers to 
solicitors offices whose addresses have been-circulated on 
some right-wing groups they are very concerned about what 
could-happen next and this is why people are fearful they 
have heard the prime-minister's words but they wonder is he 
really going to be able to stop whatever-happens next and 
today another reminder of the real life consequences the 
Royal-College of GPS have said that some of their members 
health care workers have-been abused particularly those 
from Minority ethnic backgrounds and they say-this is the 
real life consequences of the disorder and the atmosphere 
that has-been created on our streets dasna there thank you 
and-apologies if you heard any bad language there as we can 
see it is live and as-we've been hearing in South Yorkshire 
not far from here police have condemned-what they've called 
a disgusting display of thuggery following the disorder 
at-that wam Hotel housing Asylum Seekers last night at 
least 12 police officers-were injured by a group estimated 
to number more than 700 people local MP and-defense 
secretary John Healey said there will be a reckoning for 
those involved-Amilia Jen was there last night in wam this 
quiet suburb 10 miles away from-Ram last night became the 
scene of a pitched-battle after a crowd who' surrounded a 
hotel housing Asylum Seekers set it a-light so the police 
have managed to move a crowd around 100 to 200 down this 
end-of the road but they're still throwing glass bottles 
they're still throwing-logs and actually two boys have just 
started a fire over there by the time-police had dispersed 
the riot it was 5:00 a.m. and 12 South Yorkshire 
police-officers had been injured with rocks fences and 
other-missiles it began yesterday around 11:30 a.m. when a 
group of 250 arrived in the-Manas area of wapon dur a 
further group of around 500 people arrived shortly-after 
Who We Believe held far right and anti-immigration-Views it 
was ultimately a disgusting display of thuggery continuing 
well into-the evening the hotel's windows were smashed and 
a wheelie bin satell light-before being pushed into a 
doorway police describing a concerted effort not-just to 
damage the hotel but to inflict serious harm on those 
inside I've come-down from leads this morning this is where 
I'm from about living leads now-but I was just cry as out 
yesterday watching it it's awful just thinking-about the 
people inside like that is not a way to treat a human it 
turned from-peaceful into possibly some of the most 
sickening parts of society that exists-now in the UK 
where's the tolerance gone where's the understanding 
where's the-acceptance that actually some and where's the 
acceptance that some of this-is a historic failure of 
government actually process cases as well so-they're not 
sitting in hotels for all this time I spoke to one man here 
last-last year and he'd already been rehomed in another 
part of the country won't-name the place and he'd been so 
badly beaten up there it had left him with a-permanent 
disability so he'd been moved here and he was still waiting 
for his-claim to be process Liz's friend works inside the 
hotel and she's done-voluntary work here too they had some 
contact by WhatsApp and told me that-they'd been moved into 
the stairwells which had been locked for safety and one-of 
the lads had texted later in the evening and said oh don't 
worry we've-got apples and water this morning defense 
secretary in-local MP John Healey visited the site having 
spent all night with the police-he was stopped this morning 
by someone who lives nearby who repeated-unsubstantiated 
claims about inequality and policing that have been 
circulating-online I'm also hearing from a good source that 
the police have been told-not to arrest any immigrants or 
do anything nothing at all his is a-government battling not 
just sticks and stones but online agitation 
and-misinformation that will have felt all too real for the 
men evacuated from the-hotel at dawn all right-minded 
people have got to condemn what we saw-yesterday in 
rotheram and what we've seen in other towns and cities 
which is-thuggery violence disorder vandalism Unleashed 
under the banner of protest-it's unjustifiable and there 
will be arrests there will be convictions today-South 
Yorkshire police said the responsibility lay not just with 
those-bent on destruction but those spreading 
misinformation and hate online anyone-simply standing and 
watching two they described as absolutely complicit 
this-acious cycle of online and offline hate that last 
night landed here in air-village in south Yorkshire well as 
you can see the hotel-is now boarded up there's still a 
police presence here in South Yorkshire police-say they 
have arrested uh six men in connection with uh the violence 
here but-they expect that number to rise significantly 
detectiv are currently-sifting through hundreds of uh hours 
of footage and as you heard there we were-here this morning 
speaking to volunteers alongside them was at the metr May 
of-South Yorkshire Oliver copard and this afternoon he 
released statement about-what had happened here last night 
and he said the farri right have always asked-those with 
little to blame those with even less he said that this had 
nothing-to do with the three little girls from Southport 
and he said that racism was-not patriotism he said violence 
is not grief thanks Amelia well with me here in-Birmingham 
now sures Grover who is director of the anti-racist charity 
the-monitoring Group which was set up in the wake of deadly 
racist violence in the-1970s Paul at Hamilton is the labor 
MP for Birmingham erdington and Gali Pas-came to the UK 
having fled Afghanistan and now campaigns for refugees 
rights I-mean Sur you you you're a veteran of all of these 
race attacks racist riots in-the 1970s and 80s how does 
this compare this is unprecedented we seem to have-leap 
frogged from Europe France and globally a new kind of 
fascism a new era-of fascism which is bent on the murders 
intent to kill people Target refugees-and Muslim 
communities in a system systemic way and what we had 
was-individuals uh taking law to their own hands and 
beating us up and creating-murder and hem with political 
forces supporting them it's unprecedented-because you have 
the edl led by Tommy Robinson Street Fighters 
supported-implicitly or explicitly by reform UK in 
Parliament they are two sides of the-same coin I mean we 
should say that they they they say they condemn the 
violence-they say they condemn the V but look at the 
messaging if you look at the-messaging they have been 
saying that every occurrence that takes place with-some 
South Asian person is held responsible or named responsible 
for-some kind of attack it's as if this is done by people 
who are criminals and-they the the thing you know that that 
does have Echoes again of what happen in-the 20th centuries 
tonight we saw um with Das n there are young men from-these 
targeted communities who are coming out to defend their 
homes and-families and there is a danger here isn't there 
of of two two people you-know two groups Clashing of actual 
race riots there are two different groups one-is actually 
committing the violence against the community the others 
are-defending themselves and we have to accept the right to 
self-defense that's-the key lessons of 1970s it's not 
enough to send symbolic messages or national-messages about 
the police must do this they must use the a force of the 
law-what you have to do at the same time is to make sure 
those communities who are-directly attacked Asylum Seekers 
Muslim communities black and minority ethnic-communities 
their representatives their communities are also spoken to 
by the-government and reassured that those attacks will be 
stopped Paul that I mean-we've seen K starm IAT Cooper 
trying to give that reassurance absolutely it's-clear that 
you know people do not feel safe tonight so that 
reassurance hasn't-quite landed but there's lots of work 
going on locally like with MPS like-myself going out to the 
local mosques going to the local community making sure-that 
the messages are actually down given on the ground to local 
people do-you think there's enough police on the streets um 
the Le um the Prime Minister-has made it absolutely clear 
that the police will be there they are there for-when 
they're needed and the police have done a phenomenal job 
and under-absolutely difficult circumstances and they are 
there they will be there and-they've been given 
reassurances to both myself as an MP and to the 
local-communities but it's that visual presence isn't it 
you know in the 2011-riots we remember there was a massive 
ramping up of police on the streets to-make people feel 
safe and we haven't quite got to that yet have we I mean 
you-know here there are businesses closed cafes have all 
shut up early saying-they're afraid there aren't any police 
out here at this moment in time the-police are there they 
will be deployed if needed let's get this right this 
is-violence and thuggery this is not a legitimate campaign 
and or demonstration-and we have to clamp down on it and 
the police and the government are working-hard to make sure 
that every single person that's involved with it they 
will-face the full force of law I me G as a as a refugee 
who works with other-refugees do you feel reassured tonight 
to be honest I've never been this afraid-I've lived in the 
UK for the last 17 years I've been a citizen for the 
last-five or so and as a refugee as an aam I saw the 
dehumanizing language the scape-boarding but now like I'm 
afraid from my kids I told my wife don't go to the park-you 
know I had to travel from Bolton yesterday to King to take 
my girls to to-Nursery because I was afraid for my wife to 
walk on the road it's scary and I-think it's it's there's 
no legitimate concerns when this this TX comes out the-the 
racist against Muslim and refugees and sadly the media been 
portraying as-though they were misinformed or there's 
misinformation although if this this guy-who did this 
criminal act of killing these innocent children which my 
our-sympathy should goes to the family even if he was a 
Muslim even if he was a-refugee does not mean you have to 
go after the whole group in the whole-ethnicity in the 
whole religion we need to criminal to be treat as criminal 
and-brought to justice so I feel like the media and some 
politician has actually-made it worse and I think you know 
they need to take some responsibility for-their wording I 
remember speaking to you before the election asking 
about-compassion and you know and sadly things has turned 
out to be quite quite bad now-this I I don't I think this 
was this was pre preventable and predictable because-the 
way the media and politician has been speaking about people 
like me and-dehumanizing me and thinking I'm somehow the 
problem for the the crimes in the-social housing and so on 
and so forth Paul that do do you think this is 
as-spontaneous as it you know appears to some as if it just 
come out of nowhere-it's it's it's very organized it was 
done through social media and absolutely-absolutely what 
I've seen on social media social media can be a force 
for-good but what this has done it's created a whole level 
of um threats and violence-and intimidation that I have 
never seen before I was involved in the 20111 riots-when it 
was in the city center and I have never seen anything as 
bad as it is-at the moment and it's organized Sur when you 
see those images-of the police being attacked taking a 
beating to protect minority communities-you know times have 
changed haven't they and times have changed times 
have-changed but do you see this also as an intelligence 
failure yes I see that-because I think rodum attack could 
have been prevented I rang rodam holiday in-couple of days 
ago with friends of mine warning them what would happen and 
I-think it should have been created a sterile area should 
be created around it-so no protest should have taken place 
it's lucky that we did not see any-killing or you know 
fatality or injury at rodam yesterday or day 
before-yesterday I think the other other thing is you know 
it's no good labor saying-and condemning the worst excesses 
when they happen they have a duty to explain-and not use 
the language that refugees are talking about Muslims have 
been-demonized um refugees have been demonized immigration 
is seen as a hard-rock that needs to be dealt with that 
humanization let me give you an example-I'm not give me one 
brief I mean we saw in Parliament only 5 days ago A 
Member-of Parliament for 10 worth actually made holiday in 
5 days ago and that ins Min-absolutely made clear Sak St 
andet Cooper that this will not be tolerated-this language 
this treatment of minority communities will not be 
tolerated and it-they will clamp down really hard and we 
have to allow the government to do their-job and do you 
think they're calling it what it is is it enough to call 
it-thuggery or should they be calling it well I'm calling 
it islamophobic and-racist it's is it's is islamophobic and 
racist and I'm absolutely sure that is-what it is just last 
word what do you want tonight I want peace and I want I 
I-came to the UK for safety and protection and this is not 
okay this is not this is-not on and these young people we 
need to help this young people I see the-inequality the 
injustices in the UK but you know I'm all for peaceful 
protest-come out and raise your concern but breaking down 
and burning things and-targeting MOS targeting businesses 
this is not the way to go protest indeed it's-not is 
thuggery this is violence of the worst kind this is picking 
on a-community that people think are defenseless and people 
that have come-from abroad that help us that they think are 
defenseless and they are absolutely-demonizing them and 
consist we have to be consistent not just shortterm 
labor-has a duty to call out islamophobia call out racism 
call out fascism it doesn't-do that we we must leave it 
there thank you all very much indeed for joining us-for now 
well so stama has warned that anyone whipping up violence 
online will-face the full force of the law his comments 
came in the wake of increasing-scrutiny of social media 
platforms and the role they have played in the-organizing 
and incitement of the violence over the past week 
Downing-Street also condemned the billionaire Tech boss 
Elon Musk who claimed on-social media that Civil War is 
inevitable but exactly how can Mass-misinformation be 
confronted our senior political correspondent Paul 
magnamar-reports the video shared on Saturday night by-the 
far-right activist Steven yaxley Lennon more commonly known 
as Tommy-Robinson a video retweeted by an account with 3 
million followers asking what's-going on in the UK 
retweeted again with their answer the effects of 
mass-migration and open borders is what's going on and a 
reply from billionaire-and owner of EX Elon Musk Civil War 
is is-inevitable it was a post for which the Prime Minister 
was forced to respond to-today his spokesperson saying 
quote there's no justification for comments-like that the 
message from government social media has a responsibility 
here-not just those that use them but those that own them 
too they need to take some-responsibility for the things 
that are taking place on their platforms that-they frankly 
are making huge amounts of money-from they need to be doing 
far more to engage to remove criminal posts that are-still 
up to tackle misinformation and to take some responsibility 
for what is-happening firms will face the full force of the 
laws say government and that law-is changing thanks to the 
Online safety act but not all of it has been-implemented 
yet what does the full force of the law actually look like 
at the-moment we don't have the full range of enforcement 
options at this moment in-time that we would hope for but 
something we will have is in the-future the ability to find 
companies a percentage of their Global Revenue when-they 
are not uh uh holding up their end of the bargain under the 
Online safety-act and this includes enforcing their own 
policies around misinformation the-glorification of 
violence and hate speech okay so at the moment the 
social-media firms don't need to be that worried there are 
other mechanisms in-terms of public shaming but when you're 
looking at actual impacts under law then-then yes 
unfortunately there are not the same-consequences now as 
there would be in 2025 and 26 as the Osa is-[Applause] 
enforced it's not just policing online-which has come under 
criticism but actions of the police and government in-the 
real world too accusations that those on the left and right 
wing are-been pleased differently this morning writing 
on-social media reform UK leader Nigel farage called for 
Parliament to be-recalled he condemned this weekend's 
violence but warned ever since the soft-policing of the 
black lives matters protest the impression of two 
tier-policing has become widespread there's a clear 
difference between effectively-blocking streets or roads 
been closed to burning down libraries hotels food banks-and 
attacking places of worship what we have seen is thuggery 
violence racism so-there's not two-tier policing that we 
cannot-those kinds of comments are simply not relevant 
right now that is not correct-it is not correct it's a 
question the Metropolitan Police Chief s Mark 
Rowley-wouldn't even engage with today are we going to end 
two-tier policing-sir but as long as riots on Britain 
streets continue so to will questions-about how we're 
placed and governed on and-offline we actually received a 
statement from SM Mar Ry about that incident just-as we 
came to a essenti he said he was leaving a meeting with the 
Prime-Minister it was a prime minister's moment to talk he 
said quote in an-effort to move a microphone out of my path 
I'm sorry I knocked it to the floor-that was never my 
intention in another unique twist there in the last 
hour-we've seen ELO must tweeting directly to sikir starma 
S starma issued a statement-to X um saying that what we've 
seen today is not a protest it's pure-violence he ended it 
with we will not tolerate attacks on Moss or on 
Muslim-communities to which Elon mus replied quote 
shouldn't you be concerned about-attacks on all communities 
well given how seriously we've seen the government-talk 
about social media responsibilities this week uh today it's 
pretty-extraordinary response for a or must there and a 
glimpse into the mindset of-at least one social media boss 
Paul magnamar well earlier I spoke-to the former prison 
Governor Ian atcherson he's now senior advisor to 
the-counter extremism project and I asked him if the police 
and Security Services-should have seen these riots coming I 
know there's been some-criticism of um a lack of 
preparation it seems to be in relation to rotheram 
and-particular and the the hotel there that was besieged by 
people that were intent-on if they could I think killing uh 
the occupants that there was Intelligence uh-that that did 
exist that should have meant that the police response uh 
that-defensive response around that hotel was much greater 
I think what you saw uh-were were police that were almost 
overwhelmed and we could have had an-absolute tragedy that 
would have ignited uh this uh civil disorder into 
something-much worse had that had that occurred there needs 
to be a reexamination of of-police tactics we simply don't 
have enough you know cops around in the-country to be able 
to sustain the rates of injury and assault I mean one of 
the-lessons of 2011 I remember was that the police were out 
on the streets Rel ly-quickly you know we we you know quite 
fast we saw a lot of officers out trying-to give 
reassurance do you think that's happened-yet I mean I'm in 
Birmingham where there have been warnings of uh of 
gatherings-today and I haven't seen any police on the 
streets well you know I think I do-have some sympathy here 
for the the policing posture it's extraordinarily-complex 
sometimes and I think there's some research that followed 
2011 putting-more police officers on the ground can 
actually um aggravate a situation and-draw more people in 
than uh would otherwise be the case so there's a very-fine 
balance that has to be uh met and you know if uh as Sir K 
starmer has said-there's a determination to put these 
people behind bars I simply have no idea-where they're 
going to go because we do not have the capacity at the 
minute in-the prison service to deal with the population 
that exists let alone a surge-of angry and alienated young 
people the state must now um dispense with you know-uh any 
Naval gazing and deal with the the problem of of total 
incivility and-impunity that is allowing these awful acts 
of Destruction to happen what about-the extremism itself 
what do we now need to do about that well I mean I've 
argued-to government over a number of years that our uh 
counterterrorism policy or-national policy contest which as 
you know contains all those peas prevent-pursue prepare and 
protect needs an additional um arm to it called promote-and 
and that is about figuring out how we deal with extremism 
In Pockets of the-country often Pockets that have other 
multiple problems like social um-inequality and deprivation 
and so on and and how we um stop those communities and-a 
lot of them are in the the former mid towns across the 
north of England and-along the Eastern seab Board of the 
country H how we um analyze the the-problem here where uh 
social integration uh seems to have failed and we need 
to-do something to stop that inevitability of these people 
being radicalized or-mobilized in some way or believing you 
know they've got the the impunity to act-in the way that 
they did in our streets and that requires a you know uh 
a-complex and probably uncomfortable conversation about why 
those people I'm-talking about young people uh you know are 
are behaving in the way that they-they have we have this uh 
you know Confluence of media and by which I mean-you know 
television new CH television channels and social media 
and-politicians and newly elected politicians who are 
feeding into this-rhetoric um and that's a new thing for us 
isn't it yes and I think you know-there there is a a 
responsibility and all of us who talk about these 
awful-events to uh you know speak in in measured tones and 
you know be United in-saying that there is no excuse for 
this Behavior at all there is no-contextualization about 
assaulting police officers about trying to burn-down hotels 
about destroying your own neighborhood about looting and 
damage-and and destruction that has to be you know 
straightforwardly condemned uh and-it must be ashon thank 
you very much thank-you it's a wellestablished pattern 
first there's the riot then the cleanup today-from dawn 
hundreds of people were on the streets of central mburg 
cleaning up-after scores of houses and vehicles were 
damaged in yesterday's serious violent-disorder which 
spanned many hours well our chief correspondent Alex son 
is-there now Alex yes given the violence that-unfolded here 
yesterday naturally it's taken PE people through the night 
really-to assess the extent of that uh we're standing now 
in front of the Law Courts-you could probably see Windows 
boarded up off they were smashed by riers just-along the 
way you have tside University same thing happened there 
Windows-smashed by riers during late afternoon yesterday 
this afternoon the university-issued us a statement saying 
that they paid Tri tribute to the people who came-along 
quite unasked to help clear up the mess and they said that 
that represented-the true Spirit of tside and Middlesboro 
well we saw a good deal of that spir-Spirit on the streets 
from the early hours of this morning but also of 
course-that took place after several hours of concerted 
violence albe it in specific-areas but intense violence 
over several hours you're never going to win here by-ha 
you've got to fight love Liv here 25 years I've never 
seen-anything like this before in my life ever skill to 
spread racism and-violence police drafted into Middlesboro 
yesterday from across the northeastern-Cumbria well over 50 
arrests by this morning police warning riers there will-be 
more mounted-units dog team but what happened in the side 
streets-where police couldn't always be and the riers 
knew-it oh this is crazy that car burned out near 
garet-Street in the Town Center smashed in the windows on 
this-new build estate then the crossed over and they went 
one end to the other of-garnet Street smashing up every 
single car on the street-and quite a few front windows as 
families were carrying inside with-children no police no 
hurry strolling along Garnet-Street attacking the vehicles 
breaking people's front windows-Wherever Whenever they feel 
like it many of them teenagers some appeared-much younger 
than that student and care worker from Ghana-Edward Bono 
discovers what they've done to his car I we are 
very-devastated don't know what to do Nigel Parry a care 
home manager Edward's-nextdoor neighbor I guess the guys 
was all about it being a kind of a political-rally I think 
but it really what it was was just an excuse for a gang of 
thugs-to run around smashing cars up how would I say very 
painful yeah know some of my-children were even traumatized 
the-fear about what is happening we have to come them and 
talk to-them a few doors along this man's three children 
were on the sofa when the front-window came in I had this 
smash on the car a rior cut himself so badly on the-glass 
he ripped down the curtains for a bandage he kept the Blood 
Stained Glass-to help police investigate so he left it then 
if you guys see that's a-the sample of his blood so I had 
to Pi it to keep maybe if the police because I-bring in the 
police in case they come and they need to see something 
about it-and if you watch you could still see SC of-blood 
this morning a new day on so many levels hundreds out early 
and of course-they came along to Garnet Street in force 
everyone who come out to that-match yesterday it it was 
about color and it was about anyone Muslim basically-that 
we feel that we are being targeted for our religion yeah no 
doubt about it-I didn't think we were like that you I 
didn't think there was people people you-like that and like 
when when it happens on your own front door it comes on 
to-you then as well so we can't rebuild that but we just 
want to still rebuild-our community with everybody else and 
change people's mindsets that we all he-it together Peter 
and Gloria too live in-Garnet Street the Family Once More 
in the front room when the riers-arrived everybody was here 
sitting all my kids was sleeping here before they-Happ my 
first daughter all the body was blood yesterday because the 
glass-because they broke the window from outside the splash 
of the glass injured-her on the hand she's very scared one 
of their daughters cut by flying-glass and when they feel 
able they'll find at least the worst of the mess-cleared up 
by middlesbor best Alex Thompson reporting there some-of 
the first people to be charged in relation to the riot 
started to appear-in court earlier today they have been 
prosecuted after violence erupted in-places including 
Sheffield Sunderland harleypool and Belfast our 
reporter-Andrew misra is at Liverpool magistrates Court 
Andrew-Aisha we started to get a sense of the scale of the 
task in bringing those-involved in these riots to Justice 
11 people appeared before magistrates in-merys side to face 
charges relating to the riots in Liverpool over the 
weekend-and in Southport last week nine of them faced a 
charge of violent disorder and-six of them pleaded guilty 
to that charge the youngest of them 14 years old-who we 
can't identify for legal reasons the oldest 69-year-old 
William Nelson-Morgan who brought a wooden bat to riots in 
Liverpool on Saturday night Derek-Drummond who's 58 also 
pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker 
in-Southport last week and the court was shown bodyw warn 
footage of an officer-being punched in the face by Drummond 
as he was trying to protect his colleagues-who were putting 
riot gear on Two Brothers Adam and Ellis Warton 
weren't-charged with violent disorder but did plead guilty 
to burgling a library that-was satellite on Saturday night 
and as Adam Warton whose 28 was led back down-to the cells 
he said nice one lad before swearing at the district judge 
the judge-remanded all of the adult defendants into custody 
and they will appear before-Crown Court later this month 
and while people have being brought to court-quickly here 
that hasn't been the case everywhere take Bristol for 
example-where some people accused in relation to UNR there 
won't appear in court until-September but back in merys 
side in Southport tonight the focus is not on-the riots 
that followed the stabbing a week ago today but on the 
three girls-who were killed Alice BB and Elsie and in the 
last hour people have been-gathering in the town center and 
blowing bubbles in their memory organizers say-that 
symbolizes sending kisses to them in-heaven Andrew misra 
thank you very much in Liverpool magistrates Court 
there-well tonight rival groups are engaged in a tense 
standoff in Plymouth with police-warning people to stay 
away from the city center social media footage showed-a 
large number of far-right activists hurling abuse at 
anti-racist-demonstrators and the nearby library was closed 
early as a precaution well-joining me now is the labor MP 
for Coventry South Zara Sultana um and this-is not far from 
where you live um how how are you feeling tonight about 
how-safe this country is incredibly scared while I 
represent country south I was-born and raised in birmingam 
so seeing the images that are coming out of this-city and 
the family WhatsApp groups telling each other to stay in my 
sisters-wondering if they should go into work my friends 
saying that actually they're-going to work from home this 
isn't um you know a way to be living where you're-fearful 
of walking outside in your community and perhaps not going 
into-work because you're fearful for your life but we have 
to talk about where-this comes from don't we I mean this is 
not spontaneous hasn't just erupted out-of nowhere no this 
is the culmination of Decades of uh front pages that 
have-demonized and scapegoated Muslims refugees and 
migrants this is the-product of uh rhetoric that we see 
coming from the highest offices in the-country our former 
Home Secretary uh soel bravman said that we had an-invasion 
of migrants she also recently said that the islamists and 
extremists-and anti-semites were in charge we've got uh you 
know politicians uh the-former mp uh in Leicester John 
Ashworth who said um migrants are able to uh stay-in hotels 
and stay in them for Life we've had Lee Anderson who said 
uh the-animals referring to the people in hair Hills in in 
leads um and and that-language that that that 
dehumanization um has been happening for-uh for decades in 
particular you know you've got Nigel farage who was 
recently-elected the language that he's been using about 
Muslims saying that they-don't share the values of British 
people this is where it leads to and for you la-labor isn't 
going far enough either I think the labor party needs to 
be-stronger in what it is calling for um I'm glad that 
there's been progress in-calling it islamophobic it took us 
a long time to get to that point when-Muslim communities 
are the communities that are being targeted as well as 
black-and brown people all Asylum Seekers who are well 
where arsonists are trying to-burn them alive in their 
hotels we have to see how the debate around 
immigration-which has dehumanized people has has led us to 
this point where people are being-well hotels are being 
burned but the issue right now is Law and Order and-that is 
what labor is trying to deliver I mean and K starm and IET 
Cooper have-been very very clear on that I mean is is it is 
now the time to be sort of-stirring up internal debate when 
actually this is not an internal debate-this is not an 
internal debate I always highlighted uh islamophobia in 
the-conservative party I've highlighted it in my own party 
highlighting the Ford-report which has said that there is a 
high Archy of racism at play when it-comes to islamophobia 
and anti-black racism in terms of what we need to do-now 
Law and Order is an important part of the answer but it is 
not the Silver-Bullet unless we address the fact that we 
have a deeply unequal country where-living standards have 
fallen um the lowest since records began that people-are 
dependent on food banks that wages have been uh St uh 
flatlining Al so you-need to offer different answers an 
economic these people who are taken to-the street an 
economic solution where our communities feel invested that 
they-feel supported that they don't feel left behind we 
have we have an NHS on its-knees we have our Public 
Services crumbling and what has happened is-politicians 
rather than address their own failings at this have pointed 
to-migrants who have pointed to Muslims and this is what 
we're seeing so we need to-address the the structural 
economic issues which politicians just don't want-to do and 
instead distract blame scapegoat others to to to to to 
get-people's attention um elsewhere and it's unacceptable 
and this is a product of-that um and but the context is 
different now because people are also in-Parliament with 
very controversial views you don't like I mean Parliament 
is a-Dem Democratic institution and we've all been elected 
um and we all have the same-rights and responsibilities 
what I struggle with is how people do not take-those 
responsibilities seriously where they use the platform of 
Parliament and-those green benches to perpetuate hate to 
perpetuate Division and that needs to-be condemned by 
everyone okay Z thank you very much to you for joining us 
I-suppose I wrongly called you a labor MP I mean you 
elected as a labor MP but-you're not a labor MP right now 
because kids shouldn't be in poverty in-avoidable poverty 
and that's why the was because you you you voted for the 
S&P-Amendment so to scrap the two child benefit cap thank 
you very much indeed-for joining us now um I suppose I I 
should also um just make clear that-we've been calling this 
uh rioting across the UK so far there hasn't been-rioting 
in Scotland there has been trouble in the other nations of 
the UK-uh but uh but not yet in Scotland and I know a lot 
of our Scottish viewers want-us to make that clear which 
I'm happy to Aisha thanks Christian a number of-Graves in 
the Muslim section of a cemetery in Burnley have been doed 
with-white paint it's thought that the vandalism is related 
to the farri-violence and it's been condemned by Burnley 
Council and Lancashire police-are investiga G
