60 Minutes rewind this past week the Federal 
Trade-Commission was asked to investigate the data 
collected by Google on its Android-operating system which 
Powers most of the world's smartphones it was a tiny-blip 
in the news cycle but another sign of Washington's and 
Europe's growing-concerns about the enormous largely 
unchecked power accumulated by Tech-giants like Facebook 
Amazon and Google over the last two decades of the 
three-Google which is part of a holding company called 
alphabet is the most-powerful intriguing and omnipresent in 
our lives this is how it came to-be most people love Google 
it's changed our world insinuated itself in our lives-made 
itself indispensable you probably don't even-have to type 
google.com into your computer it's often the default 
setting-a competitive Advantage Google paid billion ions of 
dollars for no worry-Google is worth more than 3/4 of a 
trillion dollars right now and you don't-get that big by 
accident since going public in 2004-Google has acquired 
more than 200 companies expanding its reach across 
the-internet it bought YouTube the biggest video platform 
it bought Android the-operating system that runs 80% of the 
world's smartphones and it bought double-click which which 
distributes much of the world's digital advertising all 
of-this barely raising an eyebrow with Regulators in 
Washington were any of-those Acquisitions questioned by the 
antitrust division of the justice-department some were 
investigated but only uh superficially-the government just 
really isn't enforcing our antitrust laws and that's-what's 
happened none of these Acquisitions have been challenged 
Gary-Reebok is one of the most prominent Anti-Trust lawyers 
in the country widely-credited with persuading the justice 
department to sue Microsoft back in the-'90s the last major 
antitrust case against big Tech now he's battling-Google 
you think Google's a monopoly oh yes of course Google's a 
monopoly in-fact there are Monopoly in several markets 
there are a monopoly in search-there are a monopoly in 
search advertising those Technologies are less-than 25 
years old and may seem small compared to the industrial 
monopolies-like railroads and standard oil a century ago 
but Reebok says there's-nothing small about Google Google 
makes the internet work the internet would not-be 
accessible to us without a search engine and they control 
it they control-access to it that's the important part 
Google is the gatekeeper for for the-worldwide web for the 
internet as we know it it's every bit as important-today as 
petroleum was when John D Rockefeller was monopolizing that 
last-year Google conducted 90% of the world's internet 
searches when billions of-people asked trillions of 
questions it was Google that provided the answers-using 
computer algorithms known only to Google they have this 
phrase they use-competition is just a click away they have 
no competition being their-competition has 2% of the market 
they 90% Jonathan taplan is a digital media-expert and 
director ameritus of The annenburg Innovation Lab at 
the-University of Southern California he says Google's 
expertise-may be technology but its business is advertising 
and its most valuable-commodity is highly specialized 
information about us it's helped Google-control roughly 60% 
of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet-tapin says 
traditional companies can't compete because they don't have 
the data-they know who you are where you are what you just 
bought what you might want to-buy and so if I'm an 
Advertiser and I say I want 24 year-old women in-Nashville 
Tennessee who drive trucks and drink bourbon I can do that 
on Google-people tell their search engines things they 
wouldn't even tell their wies-I mean it's a very powerful 
and yet very intimate technology and that gives the-company 
that controls it a mindboggling degree of control over 
our-entire Society Google is so dominant in search and 
search advertising that-analysts and Venture capitalists in 
Silicon Valley say it's extremely-difficult for startups to 
get funding if their business model requires them 
to-compete with Google for ad Revenue Jeremy stelman 
co-founded Yelp more than-a decade ago a website that 
collects local reviews on everything from auto-mechanics to 
restaurants Nationwide and makes money selling ads the 
initial-promise of Google was to organize the world's 
information and ultimately that-manifested itself in you 
expecting that the top links the things that it shows-at 
the top of that page are the best from around the web the 
best that the-world has to offer and I can tell you that is 
not the case that is not the-case anymore instead of doing 
what's best for consumers stelman says Google-is doing 
what's best for Google if I were starting out today I would 
have no-shot of building yel that opportunity has been 
closed off by Google and their-approach in what way because 
if you provide great content in one of these-categories 
that is lucrative to Google and seen as potentially 
threatening they-will snuff you out what do you mean snuff 
you out they will make you-disappear they will bury you 
Yelp and countless other sites depend on-Google to bring 
them web traffic eyeballs for their-advertisers but now 
stoppelman says their biggest competitor in the 
most-lucrative markets is Google he says it's collecting 
and bundling its own-information on things like shopping 
and travel and putting it at the very top of-the search 
results regardless of whether it belongs there on Merit so 
let's start-off with sushi he showed us how it worked by 
Googling Sushi San Francisco-all the prime real estate is 
here this is where the consumer their eye focuses-and 
that's by Design Google wants you to pay attention to their 
content all of-the information here is owned by Google from 
the maps to the reviews Stopman-says if you click on any of 
these Links at the top of the page you may think-you've 
gone to another website but in fact you will still be on 
Google seeing-what it wants you to see while it collects 
your personal information and-maybe exposes you to Google 
advertising if you click anything inside this box-you stay 
on Google and they make more money that's right Google told 
us it-doesn't have anything to do with money it's about 
improving its product by-making searches quicker and easier 
for its customers by eliminating the need to-click through 
lots of other sites Stopman says it's about 
stifling-competition pushing it down the page where it's 
less likely to be seen the-advantage he says is even more 
striking if you look at the search results on a-smartphone 
this is exactly what your phone would look like in the palm 
of-your hand this is all of Google's own property right 
here it takes up the-entire screen how important is that 
first page it's not even just the first-page it's the first 
few links on the page is the vast majority of where 
user-attention goes and where the traffic flows so if 
you're not at the top of the-page or the bottom of the 
first page or on the second page that's going to-affect 
your business yeah if you're on the second page forget it 
you're not a-real business Yelp Microsoft Amazon eBay 
Expedia and-Yahoo all complained about Google's dominance 
in what they called this-anti-competitive Behavior to the 
Federal Trade Commission which in 2011 conducted-an 
investigation according to This-Confidential memo parts of 
which were inadvertently given to the Wall Street-Journal 
years later the ftc's Bureau of competition had recommended 
that an-Anti-Trust lawsuit be filed against Google for some 
of its business-practices it said Google is in the unique 
position-of being able to make or break any web-based 
business and is strength in-its monopolies over search and 
search advertising through anti-competitive-means and for 
stalled competitors and wouldbe competitors ability to 
challenge-those monopolies it specifically cited Google for 
stealing competitors content-and imposing restrictions on 
advertisers and other websites that limited their-ability 
to utilize other search Eng but the recommendations were 
rejected it-flatly says that Google's conduct was 
anti-competitive it flatly says that-Google's conduct hurt 
consumers I mean what else would you need to know to 
vote-out a complaint there it is written by your own staff 
and yet nothing happened-they closed the case they closed 
the case-correct the ftc's Commissioners decided that 
Google's conduct could be addressed-with voluntary 
improvements to some of its business practices and that 
Google's-decision to move its own products to the top of 
the search page could possibly be-a benefit to Consumers 
but Reebok and others who were directly involved in 
the-investigation have long suspected that the outcome had 
something to do with-Google's political muscle in 
Washington and its close relationship with the-Obama 
Administration Google spent more money on lobbying last 
year than any-other Corporation employing 25 different 
firms and helping fund 300 trade-associations think tanks 
and other groups many of which influence policy-they have a 
seat at the table in every discussion that that implicates 
this-issue at all they know about developments that we 
never even hear-about so their influence uh from my 
perspective is very very difficult to-challenge the story 
will continue after this-right now the only one taking 
aggressive action against Google and the power of-big Tech 
is Margaret vtiger the competition commissioner for 
the-European Union during her four years in office vtiger 
has become a thorn in the-side of Silicon Valley finding 
Facebook $122 million for a merger violation and-ordering 
Ireland to recover $15 billion in taxes owed by Apple Last 
Summer She-levied a $2.7 billion fine against Google for 
depriving certain competitors-of a chance to compete with 
them just as well as I admire uh some of the-Innovation by 
Google over the last decade uh well I want their 
illegal-Behavior to stop and that's what you feel is gone 
on not only do we feel it-we we mean that we can prove it 
in researching the case vtiger says her-staff went through 
1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google 
was-manipulating at secret search formulas or algorithms to 
promote its own-products and services and sending its 
competitors into Oblivion it's very-difficult to find the 
rivals because on average you'd find them only on page-four 
in your search results and why so far down well because 
then you don't-find them I don't I don't know anyone who 
goes to page four on their search-result joking you could 
say that this is where you should keep your secrets-because 
no one ever comes there do you think this has been 
deliberate on-Google's part yes we think that this is done 
on purpose how do they do it I mean-I I think everybody has 
this idea that their Google has this algorithm and they-put 
the best searches right at the top well it is exactly the 
algorithm that-does it both the promotion of Google 
themselves and the demotion of others so-they're rigging 
the game yes and it is illegal Google has-paid its $2.7 
billion fine and is aggressively appealing the decision 
but-for now stelman says everyone is still playing by 
Google's rules if in business-you have to be on Google yeah 
Google wields enormous power across the-industry and they 
set the rules the question is who's watching-Google Google 
declined our request for an interview with one of its 
Executives-for this story but in a written response to our 
questions the company denied it-was a monopoly in search or 
search advertising citing many competitors-including Amazon 
and Facebook it says it does not make changes to its 
algorithm-to disadvantage competitors and that quote our 
responsibility is to deliver-the best results possible to 
our users not specific placements for sites within-our 
results we understand that those sites whose ranking Falls 
will be-unhappy and may complain publicly
