[Music] dear friends pray be Jesus and Mary as-usual as 
every month I'm going to read for you the report of maor 
July 18th-2024 on June 25th 2024 the Visionary Maria 
received the-following monthly message dear children I 
Rejoice with you and thank God for-permitting me to be with 
you to lead you and love you little children peace is 
in-danger and the family is under attack I'm calling you 
little children-return to prayer in the family put Sacred 
scripture in a visible place and-read it every day love God 
above all that it may be good for you on Earth-thank you 
for having responded to my call-[Music] a priest's heart in 
danger father Rock-an American Parish priest with 15 years 
of service was able to overcome an-obstacle that he thought 
would be impossible to survive from the very-beginning of 
his ministry he suffered great injustices certain people 
spread-all sorts of negative and false things about him 
destroying his reputation his-superiors believed these 
Slanders prolonging this dark shroud over him for-a long 
time father Rock suffered terribly and couldn't bring 
himself to-forgive these slanderers one day he went to 
confession-to a very experienced older priest who listened 
to the story of Father Rock's-misfortunes and his 
persistent inability to-forgive however rather than showing 
him compassion and understanding the-Confessor unexpectedly 
began to show father Rock his pride and-self-importance 
telling him that he was leading his own life instead of 
letting-it be led by God and His word he invited father 
Rock not only to forgive his-enemies but also to wish them 
well following this confession father-Rock felt completely 
discouraged but in the nights that followed Jesus 
worked-hard on his heart and he received the great grace to 
forgive all those who-wanted to harm him moreover in this 
unexpected outpouring of Mercy he-received the inner 
certainty that if he forgave all this evil the Lord 
himself-will protect and defend him in everything and that 
is what happened the-bad mouthing stopped from then on his 
Priestly heart was solidly mended today-he is a happy 
priest he sees this blessing from God as the great light 
of-his life as a priest the burst of a Divine joy that 
freed him from fear and-sadness once again the Living Word 
of Christ unlocked this heart that had been-trapped in 
bitterness for Years love your enemies Jesus tells us do 
good to-those who hate you bless those who curse you pray 
for those who defame you what-you want men to do for you do 
for them likewise Luke 6-27-31 enriched by this experience 
father Rock now helps those who allow their-hearts to be 
undermined and their lives to be ruined through bitterness 
and the-desire for Revenge he told me this story a young 
woman Anna generously lent-her house to her cousin without 
charging her rent so that she could look after-her 
grandmother the grandmother died 3 years later and Anna 
wanted her house-back she needed to sell it to pay for 
another house she had bought but the-cousin hired a lawyer 
her own nephew to take the house from her they both-managed 
to work around the LW of the land to fight Anna and she was 
forced-out we can imagine how revolted Anna was father Rock 
offered her a path if you-want the Lord to Reign Over your 
property he said give him permission to-defend you himself 
in order to do that I am asking you to go against your gut 
and-ask God to forgive within you all the evil that your 
your cousin and her-nephew have done against you and all 
the evil that they have spread on you also-ask him to 
ensure that they cannot keep this Otten property shortly 
thereafter-Anna returned to the priest who questioned her 
did you ask God for all-this or have you spoken badly about 
your cousin to your loved ones yes I spoke-badly about her 
I'm so angry then you haven't forgiven make a commitment 
not-to say a single negative word about your cousin on the 
contrary ask the Lord to-Grant her great blessings and to 
save her soul a radical no to hate Anna felt-terrible she 
knew that this was impossible for her her whole being 
was-filled with revolt and hatred however she decided to 
keep this commitment-through thick and thin and Faithfully 
adhere to Father Rock's proposal because-she saw that the 
light of God Shone through him 3 months later she 
was-contacted by a real estate agent who had found a buyer 
for the house and offered-to handle everything because the 
buyer himself was a lawyer in the end-everything went 
smoothly without acrimony the cousin understood that 
she-was wasting her time trying to fight this honest lawyer 
and it was a-beautiful victory for the kingdom of God Anna 
got her house back she was able to-sell it and pay for the 
new house she saw that God had acted powerfully for-she had 
left him in control of the whole situation and had said a 
radical no to-hatred let us never forget this it is God who 
forgives within us forgiveness-is not natural to us but God 
is the creator he alone can produce within us-the 
Forgiveness that our wounded human nature rejects it is 
like a new creation-it means bringing into existence 
something that did not exist before he-forgave us sinners 
the unforgivable for allowing him to die on the cross he 
the-author of life he died forgiving out of pure love for 
every one of us it is now-up to us to follow in the 
footsteps of our master and believe that if he asks-us to 
forgive it is because he has a plan of Peace for his 
children a hidden-plan that will later on appear to us as a 
wonderful-[Music] gift the Novena of night prayer on 
the-podo was a unique and extraordinary event that took 
place in June during The-Apparition on June 15th to Maria's 
surprise our lady invited us all to pray-the rosary for 
peace in the world before the 43rd anniversary of the 
apparitions-between 10: p.m. and 11:30 p.m. during these N9 
days the Blessed Mother-appeared to Maria at 11:30 p.m. and 
prayer often continued with the Luminous-Mysteries there 
was a huge response the hill was covered with people and no 
one-wanted to miss this invitation outside of magigoria 
thanks to internet-broadcasts millions of people 
accompanied this prayer as if they were-actually there my 
little personal testimony because I-am becoming frail in my 
old age it was impossible for me to climb this 
hill-especially nine nights in a row but that made me so 
sad so I said to the Blessed-Mother at least let me take 
the first steps with the crowd a generous brother-supported 
my arm but from the first black cobblestones of the P BAU I 
was-desperate saying to myself if I get as far as the first 
joyful mystery that-would already be a miracle so we took a 
break at that mystery and then we-continued the more we 
went forwards the more I-felt strength coming to me it was 
tangible so I was able to follow this-Naina to the top with 
all these wonderful people of God of all Races-peoples and 
languages which was an unspeakable joy we didn't want to 
leave-the top of the hill what a great lesson when Mary 
calls we must go and it is by-going that we receive from 
her everything we need to fulfill her desire-for us if I 
had waited until I felt the strength to climb I would have 
stayed at-the bottom of the hill of course this shouldn't 
be turned into an absolute-Rule now a question that 
everyone asks themselves why did the theotokos ask us-for 
this exceptional noena in the middle of the night among the 
rocks many-responses have been published as far as I 
concerned it is enough to note that-the Queen of Heaven and 
Earth divinely sees the whole world and its inhabitants-she 
knows the plans of God and also those of our enemy 
Satan-knowing all this she asked for our help to promote 
good to destroy an evil plan-and probably avoid the worst 
out of love for her children she clearly sees 
and-understands and tells us that the family is under 
attack and that peace is in-danger so as a mother how could 
she not count on the help of our prayer to-eradicate a good 
dose of the evils that threaten us let us not forget 
that-profound word she said on July 2nd 2014 dear children 
I want all of you-with me in Eternity for you are part of 
Me Without You Dear children I cannot-help the world I need 
you to collaborate with me in every moment of your-[Music] 
life a child screamed the scene takes-place at The 
Magnificat Retreat Center in the small Chapel adjoining the 
large-basement room a local family was invited to 
The-Apparition with the Visionary Maria but when they 
arrived the room was full they-decided to try the little 
Gallery but that was too crowded so they went to sit-on the 
steps leading to the gallery their 2-year-old little boy 
Franjo was-there with his mother seated halfway up the 
stairs they had a bird's eyee view-of what was going on 
below the little boy had often heard about Jesus and 
Mary-at home because he participated in family prayer every 
day and there he was-on that busy day at Maria's Chapel to 
make sure he wouldn't disturb others-during the prayer his 
mother pregnant with her second put a pacifier in his-mouth 
he was calm although uncomfortably Seated on those 
small-steps below everyone got down on their knees at 
Maria's-request as she did every day before The Apparition 
Maria prayed the Joyful-Mysteries with the pilgrims and 
then the sorrowful mysteries when her voice stops-sharply 
it means that the Blessed Mother has arrived and Maria has 
entered into-ecstasy her lips move but the sound of her 
voice is cut off at this moment-there is a very collected 
silence but no sooner had Maria's voice died down that-the 
2-year-old baby threw out his pacifier with his left hand 
and-immediately extended his right hand to the place where 
Maria was standing a-short distance in front of him with 
his right hand he sent kisses-and greetings and pointed to 
the place where the Apparition was taking place in-front of 
Maria his mother wondered what was happening then the child 
broke the-silence and shouted gopper gopper his mother and 
loved ones turned to him in-amazement throughout the whole 
Apparition he never stopped sending-kisses while keeping 
his face fixed in the direction of Maria in ecstasy he-kept 
his eyes wide open fully absorbed in what was mysteriously 
happening in-front of him he stared at that spot without 
batching an-eye then after four or 5 minutes Maria lowered 
her head a sign that our lady-had returned to heaven we 
started praying the magnet of her cat the little-boy then 
stopped sending kisses it was over he said nothing and went 
back to-being the normal child he had been just a few 
minutes earlier after that he-never saw the Blessed Mother 
of God again what experts have analyzed and-sought to 
understand for years what great Saints and Prophets have 
dreamed-of seeing a 2-year-old who does not yet know how to 
speak has seen with his own-eyes thank you Lord Jesus for 
the children you have placed Among Us at 2-years of age 
they are so so pure their innocence moves us the kingdom of 
God-belongs to them and to all who are like them Jesus 
tells us oh Lord please-protect the innocence of the 
children of today May evil crash to the ground-before the 
innocence of children evil has already been defeated by 
the-innocence of a woman the one whose heart is 
immaculate-[Music] dearest gospa more than ever in 
these-times of trial we want to stop complaining and 
instead contemplate what-is beautiful what your maternal 
heart reveals to us and all the treasures of-love it 
contains please help us lift our eyes to your son Jesus for 
from his open-heart has sprung our salvation and the true 
peace for which we long for so-anxiously may God bless you 
all my dear friends in the name of the father and-the son 
and the holy spirit amen [Music]-oh [Music]
