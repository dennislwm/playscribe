good morning family how are y'all doing today well I have a 
treat for you I have-Chris from Morning Star he is the 
president of Morning Star Ministries if-you don't know him 
I don't know where you've been but I'm just going to 
say-this man walks in a very powerful powerful prophetic 
anointing and I'm-excited to have him on here today and uh 
just just showing you know Prophet-shouldn't be Rogue you 
know where one is out prophesying some weird word 
that-you're going what what is that what is what are they 
saying they should go-together they should be like out of 
out of two or three mouths let every word be-established 
the Lord wants us to as the body of Christ we are we are a 
body-one's the arm one's the leg one could be the heartbeat 
or whatever but I'm just-saying we flow a as as a unit and 
and it's amazing whenever I hear the words-that the Lord 
has given this man and how they're so-precise and he shows 
him detail and then I I look at what the Lord has showed 
me-and they go and it's like a it's like putting a puzzle 
together what's is so-amazing it's like it's like boop boop 
boop you put the pieces and you go oh-that's the that's the 
picture right there we can see it so whenever you see-the 
picture put together then the it's clear but God doesn't 
give everything to-me and then he doesn't give everything 
to Chris but whenever you put us-together we have a hole 
and so it's awesome because you know we hear in part-and we 
see in part but we see this man of God having visions and 
dreams and the-Lord shows them things of things to come 
they're warnings just like me and most-people say well 
you're de you're Doom and Gloom and then and and 
everything-but I say hey but but but the Chris is getting 
the same things and it's not a-call to fear it's a call to 
prayer it's a call to intercede for this nation and-to 
believe that that God has uh exceedingly abundantly above 
all that we-dare ask or think that he is going to come 
through and that we are able to-believe that all the 
demonic stuff is going to be stopped it's not for going-oh 
no we got to go hide underneath a rock we're going to 
believe for God to-do like I just said so but I want Chris 
to tell you all about what what's on his-heart and what the 
Lord is showing him and he I'm like I'm saying we like 
I-said we have some amazing uh thing visitations that we we 
can share-together here and we're just going to bounce off 
each other here so Chris what-what is the Lord showing you 
well Brandon I just uh I want to say I-appreciate you so 
much and when I saw uh you sharing the visions and-things 
the Lord was giving you I instantly knew I thought I see a 
real-gift in this man wow and I felt and I began to talk to 
some other leaders in-the body of Christ and I really felt 
like I needed to personally reach out to-you you know your 
Trump prophecy the bullet going past the ear um but 
several-things including up till today with you were 
warning about the trains and France-and Paris and the 
Olympics but you know you mentioned a verse uh a minute 
ago-the Apostle Paul mentioned where he said we know in 
part and we prophesy in-part many people that don't believe 
in the gifts of the Spirit will be upset-with us or 
discredit the prophetic because we don't know in full 
or-prophesy in full especially those in the-cessationist 
camp you know they try to they try to discredit us as not 
being uh-functioning in the nine gifts of the Spirit but 
you hear a lot of them they-don't have the nine fruit of 
the spirit right the things they say and and-threats they 
make I mean where's love and joy gentleness yeah you know 
the-real question is it was agabus in the book of Acts was 
he a true Prophet well-anybody that believes the Bible is 
the infallible word of God I do and I know-you do too the 
truth is yes the Bible is infallible and so the Bible calls 
in-Acts 11: 28 agabus is actually confirmed as a true 
prophet and he foretold a-coming famine so we see this as 
an example of New Covenant prophecy he-foretold a coming 
famine what what was the purpose in it just so he could 
say-that he prophesied it no he prophesied it and the 
church took action and they-to help those who you know 
almost like Joseph during the seven years of of-difficulty 
they he the church began to heed his word and they began to 
store up-goods and they actually begin to send disaster 
relief to help those in need-because the prophetic gave 
them insight into something that was coming so he-gave a 
national or International prophetic word about a famine the 
church-res responded they prepared and they were able to 
preserve themselves and-help others With Disaster Response 
and disaster relief but there's another-prophecy he gave 
one is international the other one was a personal 
prophetic-word and that is he gave that prophetic word to 
the Apostle Paul and I just want-to read it to you Acts 
chapter 21 verse 10 and 11 as we were staying there 
in-cesaria Philippi for some days a prophet named agabus 
came down from Judea and-coming to us he took Paul's belt 
and bound his own feet and hand and said-this is what the 
holy spirit says in this way the Jews at Jerusalem will 
bind-the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the 
hands of the Gentiles so-the overall gist of agabus is New 
Covenant prophecy is accurate but the-truth is some of the 
details were a little different than what he said does-that 
make him a false prophet absolutely not because the Bible 
the infallible-inspired word of God calls him a prophet but 
there were some of the details about-who would arrest him 
that is such a good word and how that would happen were 
a-little bit different than the details that he gave so um 
because we know the-the the the Romans ultimately uh 
arrested him and uh and I think that's-important and so you 
know he said one group would arrest another group ended-up 
doing it so this puts those who don't believe in the gifts 
of the Spirit in a-real bad spot because here we see a New 
Covenant Prophet a new testament Prophet-who gives a 
prophecy that's accurate but some of the details were 
either missing-or not exactly as they played out and that 
does not make him a false prophet-and I would simply say 
that requires those who don't believe that the 12-gifts of 
the of of the spirit are not for today I mean it's hard to 
think-isn't it that when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 12 he was 
only meaning them-to last for about 20 or 30 years writes 
you know in the 50s-ad the book of First Corinthians are 
around that time and then somewhere-before the end of the 
first century everything that he just wrote is-completely 
nonvalid and and that that's the point that I'm trying to 
make is-they they use the verse and and and if I can just 
add this verse as well I think-it's important to uh mention 
this but this is in also in the book of Acts I'm-sorry in 
the book of 1 Corinthians because it talks about in 1 
Corinthians-13 1 Corinthians 12 is the nine gifts of the 
Spirit tongues interpretation of-tongues discernment 
prophecy Gifts of healing Miracles Faith word of wisdom-and 
word of knowledge um and so here in 1 Corinthians 13 He 
talks about love all-prophecy has to be done through the 
foundation of love it can't be out of-manipulation it can't 
you know and I've had a journey I've had to learn a lot 
of-things I've made a lot of mistakes along the way but I 
think it's important for-the church to have a safe 
environment where we learn to hear God's voice and-how he 
uniquely speaks to us but just just a second he says right 
here he says-in 1 Corinthians 138 Love Never-Fails I say 
this to my cessationist brethren I recognize them as 
brothers-but they won't recognize you or I some not all but 
some love never fails-but whether there are prophecies they 
will fail whether there are tongues they-will cease whether 
there is knowledge it will vanish away for we know in part 
we-prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come 
then that which is in-part will be done away then he says 
when I was a child I spoke as a child I-understood as a 
child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put 
away-child ish things for now we see in a mirror dimly you 
and I are seeing-through a mirror dimly we're seeing parts 
we knowing Parts but then fullness-are face to face so this 
is what the question that I want to say to all those-who 
say that when that which is perfect has come is the 
canonization of-scripture they believe that verse it's a 
total argument by the way from-Silence wouldn't you think 
if the Bible was going to say after the first century-the 
gifts of the Spirit would be done away with entirely don't 
you think-there would at least be a verse that would say 
something like oh by the way-heads up this is only going to 
last for a generation or two yes this is only-going to last 
once the Canon of scripture is complete this is only 
going-to last till 70 AD or till the end of the first 
century but there's not one-single verse anywhere that says 
that they take this one verse that I'm about-to read again 
and they put a spin on so their whole argument is-number 
one from silence and from number two it's an inference if 
when that which-is perfect is come that which is in part 
will be done away remember we said we're-prophesying in 
part we're knowing in part right but in a future time 
we're-going to know face to face we're not going to be 
looking through a dim mirror-but we're going to see things 
clearly if that so when that which is perfect has-come they 
say is the canonization of scripture so they say so when 
the Bible-was completed or the end of the first century or 
whichever particular view-they subscribe to they say 
prophecies ended and tongues cease but here's the-argument 
that they often Overlook knowledge would also have to 
vanish away-because whatever is it is when that which is 
perfect is come tongues cease-prophecies fail and knowledge 
vanishes away are we really going to argue that-when the 
Bible was canonized that knowledge vanished away the truth 
is-knowledge is escalated tremendously even in the 2,000 
years the last 100 years so-when tongues and prophecies 
cease or fail knowledge also has to vanish away-that did 
not happen at the canonization of scripture and so the 
whole argument-on cessationism hes on that verse that says 
1 Corinthians 13 uh 10 when that-which is perfect has come 
then that which is in part will be done away their-whole 
argument for the belief that the gifts of the Spirit no 
longer exist-today is is is being able to spin an argument 
from just out of pure inference-that which is perfect is 
come they're trying to say that's the canonization 
of-scripture but they have no text before or after that 
says that's what that-which is perfect has come wow no it's 
when Jesus comes when Jesus comes the-second time we'll see 
things fully not dimly through a mirror and we won't 
need-prophecy we won't need tongues and knowledge will be 
complete it'll be full-so we we prophesy in part uh our 
knowledge is in part but when Jesus the-one who is perfect 
comes then we'll know everything we'll-see things face to 
face so once again I want to make this emphatic statement 
the-entire doctrine of cessationism hinges on-when that 
which is perfect is come is the canonization of scripture 
but it's a-total inference there's no verse that says that 
there's no verse that says the-gifts of the Spirit would 
end there's no verse that says when that which is-perfect 
has come is the canonization of scripture it's a complete 
argument from-silence and that is the root basis for their 
entire argument against the gifts-of the Spirit Well drop 
the mic-Boop wow that was phenomenal great job I can say 
that without hating them yeah I-believe some of the 
cessationists I disagree with them-strongly I think John 
MacArthur is an incredible Bible teacher I really do 
I-listen to him often I disagree with him on on on some 
things but the doctrines-of justification by faith 
bible-based teachings they're great but for some-reason and 
I understand there has been a lot of some wacky stuff those 
who are-either you know immature in the in spiritual gifts 
or they're lacking in-understanding or they're lacking in 
process or they're lacking in experience-and so they use 
those most extreme examples to paint with a broad 
brush-everybody who believes in the gifts of the Spirit and 
I'm simply saying their-whole argument hinges on an 
inference of what that which is perfect is come means-and 
it never says that means it's the canonization of the Bible 
That's amazing-good good word good word Chris I I was 
people need to know that and they need-to hear this and 
they should listen to this over and over again because 
right-there that right there was was meat and that was well 
you know you get the milk-of the word and there's meat of 
the word and that right there sir was the meat-and so I 
hope so I hope so because people need to uh to to grow that 
that-right wow it blessed me um because it was so perfect 
it was you know even the-way you said it so I um okay well 
what is the so what words do you feel are-coming like to 
pass very soon in your spirit that that the Lord has given 
you-couple of things I want to mention of course-obviously 
when I said there was a 16-month process from April of 2024 
when-the eclipse happened April 8th and there were 
three-days before the eclipse there was a 4.8 earthquake 
pointing to an eclipse on 48-and it was the biggest 
earthquake that hit the area the DC area up in that area-in 
over a hundred years so I felt like that was a fulfillment 
of Prophecy I-said there would be a shaking coinciding with 
the eclipse the timing of the-eclipse three days before the 
eclipse the next thing I talked about was the-16-month 
period the eclipse in the dream I saw a woman conceive a 
child okay and-about the time she started showing whatever 
time I mean I know it varies-from woman to woman from about 
three four five months the time she started-showing there 
began to be traumatic events that threw her into 
pre-labor-that there were braxon Hicks contractions the 
point is several times-the baby was not only potentially 
going to be born premature but be lost that-the baby or The 
Rebirth of America be lost and I said in that 16-month 
period-I said from April of 2024 to July of 2025 there was 
one date that was-highlighted to me in that 6 18 month 
process now I I admit when I saw it in-the dream I saw the 
month of July and I saw I didn't see the year I saw July 
the-11th circled and I knew that that was a date that we 
were supposed to pray about-okay but because I saw it in go 
from beginning April 24 till the end of July-25 I put it 
right there well you know July the 11th and this on March 
the 10th-this wasn't the case July the 11th ended up being 
the sentencing date scheduled-for Donald Trump yes the 34 
felony counts that uh he was found guilty of J-judge uh 
merchon or however you say his name but then interestingly 
enough even-though that was set for 7-Eleven by the way I I 
do understand why somebody would-have thought I didn't I 
didn't even think about whether it was ju July the-11th in 
2024 or July the 11 2025 I just saw that date highlighted 
and I put it-there because I I said the time period the 
16-month time period was from April-of 2024 till July of 
20125 oh and by the way parenthesis July the 11th that 
date-was highlighted to me so we begin to pray right this 
is unprecedented U the-nominee of a major political party a 
former president is about to be sentence-which could throw 
the nation into chaos right before the election is he going 
to-go to prison I think a lot of people were wondering is 
that going to happen-well my phone blew up when his 
sentencing date was Set uh at the end of-May or early June 
because I shared this March 10th and of course then on July 
1-the Supreme Court made the rulings about the um you know 
the immunities that-presidents have and some of the 
evidence that was used against Trump in that case-were 
Witnesses and testimonies from things that happened while 
he was-President so that's why they delayed the sentencing 
from July the the-11th well we passed one Mark right two 
days later July the 11th 12th then the-13th you saw and I 
want you to I'm going to hurry and finish here you saw 
the-bullet fly past his ear that was the part you saw 
remember we know in part we-prophesy in part this is the 
part that I saw let me start this over I'm playing-this is 
also from my YouTube this is seen a vision over and over of 
former-president Trump near a car getting in or out and 
someone trying to take him-out an assassination attempt and 
I want you to agree with me that that would be-canceled the 
Lord shows us these things so that we can come into 
agreement to-stop these things yes I want you to hear what 
I said at the very beginning of-this but I've seen a vision 
over and over of former president Trump near a-car getting 
in or out near a car trying to take now many people have 
said when I-shared this where was the car well as you know 
I saw a part you saw a part-that's why when we bring our 
parts together yep picture I think you said it-in one of 
your most recent broadcasts because I watch you regularly 
you made-interest you made made an interesting statement 
you said I have a piece of the-puzzle you have a piece of 
the puzzle here is the car that I was talking about-it was 
about 10 to 15 feet from the stage after Trump got up and 
his ear was-nicked by the bullet they you know the iconic 
raising his fist they took him-over and only 10 or 15 feet 
from the stage this was all over everywhere right-remember 
the black SUV that they put him in and then that-iconic 
photo of him raising his fist so I said I saw an 
assassination attempt on-Trump and he was near a car right 
getting in or getting out he was near a-car when this 
assassination attempt well if you look at the Evac the 
whole-picture of Butler PA the evacuation point was on the 
opposite side of the-stage that he entered now many people 
say yeah but you know of course they-would have tooken to a 
car well no they could have took him in an ambulance 
they-could have took him in a hearse but they didn't I 
firmly believe-brother with all of my heart that this is 
the grace of God yes stop this from-happening or the loss 
of the baby now you know a lot of people go ahead go-ahead 
go ahead no I'm just saying thank you Father it's amazing 
yes keep going-so once again people can dismiss it if you 
believe in the prophetic you're-going to see all of the 
reasons why it was an inpart view of a true 
prophetic-foretelling of a future event if you don't 
believe in the prophetic you're-going to look at the part 
that wasn't seen or the part that wasn't known to-disprove 
it if you do believe in the prophetic you're going to look 
at the-part we know in part prophesy in part the part that 
was seen and the part that-was prophesied to validate the 
prophetic now I know I'm saying a lot of things-here but I 
think it's important because a lot of people point to the 
parts you-didn't see or the parts you didn't prophesy to 
invalidate it you saw bullet-flying past his ear I saw it 
being near a car right and an assassination attempt-near 
and I thought his ear drum busted and people are 
criticizing that saying-well you didn't hear it all the way 
because the eard drum didn't bust that-we know of and so 
that was a total Miss and I'm like but I saw blood yeah 
what-now agabus yes agabus and I see I see I seen the blood 
flowing down his head-head and everything right here and I 
thought you know I didn't realize that's-what I trying to 
tell everybody I did not realize the bull actually Grays 
in-the the tip of his ear and um you know whatever but I'm 
just saying you know as-accurate as what you can be is I I 
you know we're all growing you were hearing-from God 
without a doubt I want to I'll finish and hurry up here so 
I've since-2021 I've been predicting Joe Biden would not 
his term would not end the way-a normal presidential 
presidential term would end since 2021 many people 
know-this this is well documented um but uh Joe-Biden May 
27th 2024 I had a dream he was giving a speech or talking 
and he seemed-to fade during the speech it was shocking to 
see him ultimately go down-and I tried to find it on 
another other news stations assuming it would be-covered 
and it wasn't isn't it interesting how that was exactly 
one-month after he stood on the debate stage talking and 
he-faded so since the eclipse on April the 8th a 4.8 
earthquake in New-York on April the 5th pointing to a 48 
April the 8th Eclipse since the eclipse-Iran attacks Israel 
with hundreds of rockets Israel strikes back also-Columbia 
and 19 other universities in 20 states have been rans 
sacked broken into-with h Hamas protesters this was in 
November of 2023 you can see the-timestamp date at the top 
a candidate for president will experience an-assassination 
attempt November 26 2023 there's 811 a.m. November-26 so as 
you know the timestamps remain whenever you make the-last 
dictation change and then I saw this November 26th-2023 
Donald Trump Health scare happens but won't stop him this 
was at the end-of last year so I was already starting to uh 
pick up things that I believe were-significant now here's 
the new stuffff this agrees with what you had this 
is-December 2022 Paris will be a hot bed of unrest-and 
riots the French people will become sick of unsustainable 
immigration coming-up from the south as well as resistance 
to the government December 12th-2022 wow you're seeing 
right now we're seeing coming into the Olympics there-will 
there already has been and will be disruptions attempts to 
bring harm fire-explosions terrorist attacks that we can 
stop now by praying against them yes and-I think macron is 
gonna fall out of popularity for a-season um I think uh 
it's interesting his name means the Mark-mcon um and so I 
think we're as I said there Paris will be a hot bed of UN 
rest-in turbulence and that was almost two years ago the 
Lord uh showed me that and-this is something else that I 
really want people to begin to pray about I-believe in 
October I first off I think we're going to see another 
assassination-attempts on the presidential candidates 
we're-going to see it again I think so I've seen something 
uh stand that one of the-president candidates I'll tell you 
who it was it was Trump and he was in a-building and there 
was a um they were trying to secure the building because 
an-explosive was threatened to come against him so I'm 
asking every person that's-watching to pray against this a 
building that was laced with-explosives that ultimately 
wanted to try where he was at and the Secret Service 
I-believe can intervene he showed me these three men 
crossing the border okay and-they were terrorists it's in 
Arizona that they crossed it was down by where-Tucson 
Arizona area is okay Tucson down that area and they crossed 
the border-excuse me secretly and the Lord warned me he 
said these three men are very bad-people okay that the one 
guy was heavy set he had a and the vision what the-Lord 
showed me and he had a great great big uh Black Beard big 
black looking-beard he was Middle Eastern and so he told me 
that they were planning in-America another type of a 911 
event these two buildings standing by themself-all of a 
sudden those buildings went and and I saw how I know it 
wasn't like 911-because that that was like it was like this 
this was coming from the inside out-and I could see fire I 
could see um I could see smoke I could see the the-pressure 
from the the the the Blast coming out of the glass windows 
but if-the enemy has his way this will happen uh another 
another thing I see a red-October I believe we're going to 
see Russia and China continue to work-together to bring 
about a coordinated attack against the us against our 
our-infrastructure against our our power grid just as we've 
seen recently with-Delta and Microsoft yes is not going to 
stop between this coordination with Iran-but but especially 
Russia and China Russia and China was just in our-airspace 
in Alaska that is coming there's going to be more of that 
in fact-I I'm telling you this I believe one of the crises 
and we need to pray against-this one of the crises in 
October I believe we're going to see September-October 
pre-election China is going to try to invade-Taiwan I've 
been saying this for over two years I've seen it I think it 
will-be ultimately unsuccessful but China will try and get 
back support from-Russia because China stood with Russia in 
their invasion in Ukraine and um I-have seen um Biden's 
term not ending normal he-stepped out of the race I saw 
that I don't pretend to see everything once-again in part 
we know in part we prophesy in part but I don't 
think-Biden's health is done failing I think something will 
trigger well he will fade-out of the picture she will have 
to emerge they're already on the news-calling her a 
co-president so watch and see that-happen and she will be 
tested and she will be seen to not be strong enough to-deal 
with the putins and the Shian pings of the world when China 
invades or-attacks Taiwan I also believe we're going to 
see-a continued effort for them to I know this may sound 
crazy but I see-an an attempted um terrorist attack within 
the-nation that could detonate in stages hijacking or 
trying to hijack the US-government foreign powers I think 
Iran is involved in this directly uh involved-in this but I 
think China is going to try to um with terrorism in the 
nation-terrorist plots pray that they're discovered pray 
that they're stopped-praying particularly for Dallas 
praying particularly for Seattle praying-particularly for 
La also praying particularly for DC and Atlanta as well-in 
Detroit those nations are or sorry those cities rather are 
being targeted-for a a terrorist attack from radical uh 
Islamic extremists that are already in-the nation and I 
think this is going to um try to come about before the 
nation I-shared over a year ago a dream so goes Israel so 
goes America I shared this on-Sid Ross program I shared it 
on Charisma I have a dream of a coordinated-detonated 
stages attempt for them to try to hijack the US government 
I'm praying-against it and I'm asking everybody watching to 
help me pray against it but-Russia particularly China will 
try to attack our our power-grid again to bring out 
blackouts blackouts blackouts remember that 
phrase-blackouts blackouts blackouts and remember this for 
Invasion Invasion-Invasion invasion remember that as we get 
close to the time of the election-Invasion Invasion 
Invasion with China China invading Taiwan and also-China uh 
making plans to try to disrupt the intelligence the power 
grid and-blackouts in America to bring confusion in 
November one last statement I also-see a natural disaster a 
catastrophe that is going to come to-Japan sometime in the 
in the future I've seen-this over and over a huge shaking 
of Epic Proportions that will hit Japan and-especially 
there in the South Pacific other areas but particularly 
Japan I've-saw um smoke from a volcanic eruption yes and 
also destruction and there is-we've got to pray against 
this but death by the thousands yes and I'm praying 
for-Tokyo there is coming a a a catastrophic event a 
natural disaster that will soon-come to Japan as we say 
this today on this date at the end of July 2024 we-need to 
pray against that yep July 26 yep 2024 Japan we're praying 
for Japan-that this will be averted this natural disaster 
of Epic Proportions a shaking-of historic size and by the 
way the the school of the prophets it's you can find-out

Amazon how cool is that book will teach you the unique ways 
that God-speaks to you Jesus said my sheep know one hear my 
voice and I promise every-person that listens I'm gonna 
make a bold promise-every person that is reading this is 
telling me they're clear clearly hearing-the unique ways 
that God speaks to them and it's because God you have a 
filter I-have a filter God can relate to you through your 
own past experiences your-certain music you like lines from 
a movie I mean things when something-resonates I teach you 
how to identify your prophetic filter so it's 
developing-your prophetic filter by Chris Reed I encourage 
you uh to get how cool is that-so let me go with the things 
that the Lord has showed me to go to it that that-go like a 
puzzle with his okay so going back to the Taiwan thing I 
saw the-Taiwan Invasion but I saw them attacking Hawaii 
before to try to take out our-military bases in Hawaii on 
the big island trying to disrupt our military as-much as 
they could so that they wouldn't have anybody uh you know 
our Midway-point to be able to go over and have like our 
fueling stations and things-like that they were they came 
against it and I saw f-16s coming in I saw people-running I 
saw the buildings on fire I saw um the the the the bombs 
blowing up-and going and it was like a surprise attack and 
the Lord said it would be-like a second Pearl Harbor coming 
and he showed me the people running trying to-get into the 
ocean and everything was on fire and it was just very they 
were like-sitting ducks they couldn't get away of course 
anybody knows it's an island but-the Lord showed me this 
and he said you must pray about this and then I saw a 
a-dragon which was I thought was very interesting I saw a 
dragon shooting-across the sky and it hit into uh the 
eastern part of America some kind of-surprise attack I 
don't know if this was actually a missile or if it was 
just-like what you're talking about um cyber warfare 
because it looked transparent I-didn't actually see a 
missile it looked like a dragon that was red and its 
face-was on like like pushing back it was going very fast 
and it was but it was-going across the the the area and I 
believe it hit in the uh Kentucky area-and so when I saw 
this I've seen this too the Lord said there would be 
cyber-attacks just like Chris was hearing and the Lord said 
they will last up to three-weeks and I think it was 
interesting that you said you said the one two three-so I 
thought that was interesting because you you quoted you you 
even-mentioned the three number but I saw three weeks some 
cities would be without-power for three weeks black 
November black November yes and it would and-people had no 
way of uh keeping their their insulin cold and things like 
that-for diabetics and it was serious but then the Lord 
showed me there would be a-a a cut off from medications 
from like heart diseases and-things like that people that 
are serious to have to have our medication shipped-over 
from overseas that um for because our supply-for medic 
medical stuff comes from a lot of China companies you know 
and so I saw-a shortage on major medicines and the Lord 
told me he said I want you to warn-the body if they have 
the ability if they are dependent on something and-their 
faith is not there for you know believing because you know 
everybody has-uh you know we start out every you know we 
all have The Measure of Faith right-but some people can 
believe God for for say we'll just take it MoneyWise 
some-people have the ability to believe God for $5-and 
there's some people that can believe God for a million 
dollars but you know-we're all a work in progress we're all 
starting out so that's what I'm trying-to tell you all if 
you don't have the you don't feel that you don't have 
the-faith to believe for your healing and you and you need 
this certain medicine-and and if you didn't have it it 
would cause you to pass away that's why the-Lord was 
warning me about this because you know we're not here to 
condemn-people we're here to help people and so um he was 
telling me Brandon there will-be a shortage in medicine and 
I'm not saying this have fear but I'm trying to-warn you is 
it was a prophetic warning about the medicines and about 
heart-medicines and things like that that would be a supply 
chain uh uh disruption-and then he warned me about the 
supply chain disruption over goods and I saw-major retail 
stores not being able to get the the supplies coming out of 
China-because of this war escalation happening in Taiwan 
there was like a a that like-they were saying we're cutting 
you all off we're not going to give anything-we're going to 
go and dominate this place and you're not going to be able 
to-get Goods uh whatever comes out of China maybe clothes 
chips whatever um you know-I know the chips come out of 
Taiwan but I'm just saying whatever what was coming-out of 
those big shipping K there was a season or for a while that 
there was-nothing on the shelves of major stores so they 
took all the stuff out of the-other stores and they brought 
it into one store in one location because the-supply chain 
was so weak in those other stores they couldn't fill all 
those-stores up and the Lord showed me it would be trade 
Wars trade wars were-coming and so um that was another 
thing and so it goes along with with what the-Lord what I'm 
trying to show you you all is that it goes alongside what 
what-Chris saw yeah and so I saw these major trade Wars I 
so so there was some cities-that only had like two or three 
stores like a Costco or Sams or a Target or-Walmart that 
were open because that's all they could remain full because 
they-were having to pull from other stores to keep that 
store full so I thought it was-very interesting and so um 
you know Chris has seen the dollar collapse of-the 50 on 
the bill dream happen right after the election I-think 
we'll see that happen after the election and and I think 
we're going to-see a significant economic crash that's 
going to come and I'm not a financial-advisor but I've seen 
it coming and it's going to be a controlled demolition 
by-the way MH uh it's going to be a controlled-demolition I 
think around the time of the election shortly after it will 
take-Donald Trump uh three or four years to get the economy 
back to where it needs-to be but oil oil oil and more oil 
under our ground Liquid-Gold is the key to helping the 
economy get back that is one of the drill baby-drill drill 
baby drill yes but it'll be a a serious-economic downturn 
that will come and they'll try to blame him for it 
because-of his you know because him I believe he'll win the 
election yeah and so when-I and I have told everybody about 
the dam with all the sludge and the barrels-the 50 gallon 
barrels well if you look at the 50 gallon barrel it's 
usually uh-about oil and it the sludge coming down is is is 
like a crude oil it's like so a-very interesting because 
the Lord's shows me these pieces of like the the 50-gallon 
drums well what else is carried in 50 gallon drums you know 
and so um-and so you know that's that's interesting but 
whenever I saw the-balloon everybody knows if you are 
familiar with my Channel about drone pal-blowing into the 
balloon and he kept blowing into the balloon and 
the-membrane kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and 
then it popped but it-popped in September October area and 
it and then it was it was a economic crisis-that was they 
were going to try to suppress until after the elections 
and-the Lord told me when the elections take place this 
will be that Dam that I'm-talking about will be a will will 
come down and all the sludge will go down-over the America 
soil and he warned me he said Brandon it there is 
great-Darkness coming in 2025 and you must pray and he said 
this there and I saw an-economic collap collapse I saw um 
the Dow Jones crashing I saw all kinds of-things so just 
like what Chris is saying about 2025 and and about the 
elections-and things like that this is stuff that I believe 
that we can either maybe-lessen and make it not as Intense 
or maybe but I don't in my spirit so far-for what I keep 
interceding about I do not feel like we can stop it I 
believe-there's plan and the Lord told me this is a 
planned-strategic crash plan and they did it on purpose 
they're doing it on purpose-because balloon until a certain 
point that's what you were seeing when when-you know Jerome 
pal was blowing in that's inflation inflation you know 
and-then all of a sudden it pops because it can't stay 
together any longer because-of the pressure and I think 
that is the economic distress that will come in a in-a day 
and the housing market and the major uh realtive you know 
like for big-buildings and stuff for for selling those they 
were on top of it and they-were shaking on that membrane 
and it was bad and said Lord watch the housing-market watch 
like I said not Financial advice but watch the housing 
market-watch the major retail business Market all that it 
was shaking underneath the-pressure of this this membrane 
of inflation yeah I mean this is this is a-ser serous thing 
I I think that it's I know right now that there-are um 
Banks and heads of banks that are doing everything they can 
um to I know-they're talking to people political leaders I 
know um religious leaders I-know I I'm talking with people 
right now that are that that not just local banks-but their 
warning there is a serious economic-downturn recession 
that's going to come that-it'll go down in history it'll 
it'll suddenly happen yeah now I'm I'm hoping-that this can 
be lessened with prayer I hope I turn out to be wrong but I 
I'm-afraid you're right the Lord hasn't told me 
specifically that it can't be stopped-but I'm afraid you're 
right I feel like it's strategic it you know 
whenever-you're in the spirit when I keep praying over it 
and I'm like because because I'm-going tell youall I don't 
want this to happen at all I don't want my kids to-have to 
go through this Absol it's terrible and so whenever you're 
seeing-in the spirit like this and I'm seeing food lines 
and they're going for a mile-down the road with people with 
Rich suits on like really like Bion nice-classy clothes and 
they're standing in line trying to find food because 
there's-no food it wasn't just like people when you say 
well these are all poor people-that are standing in line 
because they don't have any money no I'm talking the-rich 
were trying to get a bag of food because there was no food 
in the grocery-stores I saw cobwebs on the shelves in the 
corners and the Lord said I want you-to look at the cobwebs 
and he pointed to the cobwebs and said look at the 
cobwebs-that means it's a sustained thing cobwebs don't 
form overnight it's over a-a course of time so it was 
showing me a cobweb son represents this is going to-take 
some time to get back to normal and then I saw um I every 
body knows I've-I've talked about President Trump in the 
Oval Office interceding in behalf of-America and and there 
was people like pastors and people that were interceding-he 
wasn't praying in English he was praying in tongues and he 
was baptized-in the Holy Ghost and so I saw whenever he was 
doing this I saw these paddles-that that that shock the 
heart those uh Lifeline-things I saw those being hit upon 
the American soil through intercessory-prayer and whenever 
this happened it caused a ripple wave over the soil 
of-America and I saw like what you saw a rebirthing of a 
baby and I saw a-rebirthing of America and I saw a the the 
darkness of the depression that was-trying to come upon 
them land being pushed above the clouds above the tree-line 
and the Lord said there will be green times again but 
Brandon there's a-a season of Darkness now when we're 
seeing like what Chris is saying he's-saying that believe 
it starts to uplift in July I saw four oak trees and so 
I've-never understood I've tried to interpret it myself I 
am not gifted at that now-Pastor Chris is and I believe um 
I saw four oak trees and I saw these four oak-trees 
standing like like this but they lost all their leaves and 
their acorns-and I believe when I went back and I looked at 
what the oak tree represents-it represents the um American 
uh tree you know it's the it's the national tree-is the oak 
tree and so it was a strong Mighty Oak tree and it did not 
lose its-its uh life it just lost the fruit of what it had 
the leaves the O acorns and-it came on suddenly the the 
Earth got really the the area got really cold I-saw weather 
lady you can go look at that that Vision if you want to I 
won't go-into it for time sake but but I saw a power source 
coming out of the ground-and the oak tree coming and being 
planted into a 220 out plug and then I-saw a microphone 
coming up beside this uh 220 plug and it was an old 
50s-microphone like the old Tent Revival microphones and I 
saw these oak trees-starting to Glow with the glory of God 
being plugged into that that that outlet-that that power 
source and I believe there was a great Revival coming in 
this-time frame of the great economic crisis and the things 
that we're seeing that-Chris is seeing I'm seeing that 
there will be a shaking of the finances but-there will be a 
shaking in the body of Christ because I really believe 
we're-about to see one of the greatest Harvest of souls 
this world has ever known of at-least a billion Soul 
harvests we will have a major move of God ladies 
and-gentlemen before the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ 
I'm telling you and I-believe there's signs and wonders and 
creative Miracles Beyond anybody's-comprehension the Lord 
spoke to me and he said Brandon what I'm about to do is-a 
new thing behold I'm going to bring forth great uh Waters 
in the desert just-like it talks about I believe in Isaiah 
and um he said Brandon I'm going to do a-new thing the 
world has never seen what I'm about to do it's never been 
done-before ladies and gentlemen so we've seen great 
miracles in the tent revivals-in the tents in in in isua 
Street you you know we hear the stories and we hear-about 
the testimonies what happened there and um but we're about 
to see-something even greater and so I'm excited about what 
God's-about to do in this last days it's not all doom and 
gloom the sky is not-falling chick and little but there is 
a great shaking that's going to take place-before we see 
Awakening and um and I believe with all my heart we're 
about to-see this yeah I mean like I said this period from 
April of of 2024 till July-of 2025 could seem that July 
maybe is the beginning where things are starting-to to ease 
up or turn around or start to get better or or just the the 
the-glimpses of this can be fixed this can get hope yeah 
glimpses of Hope but I-think between now and the end of 
this year we're going to see um I mean I I-really do think 
that we're on the verge of more War I think that um there 
is-Chinese plans um to infiltrate the United States around 
the time of the-election I think we're going to see 
Chinese-infiltration um D you know influence directed by 
the Communist Party um you-know we love all people groups 
but you know we love all nations but because-we're here 
we're Americans we're God is you know we've got to speak to 
the-things that are coming in America and so I pray and I 
hope you will pray and all-of your listeners will pray that 
whatever bad has to happen let's pray-against invasions 
let's pray against China not attacking uh Taiwan let's 
pray-against the destruction coming to Japan of a natural 
disaster let's pray against-further assassination T let's 
pray against those kind of things but-ultimately let's pray 
for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and I 
found-historically thank you Lord that the greatest 
revivals that happen are when-people are under distress or 
persecution yes and and and you know we all want to-say 
well can't it to just happen without all that well it'd be 
great but there's-something you know there's a verse in the 
Bible that says he that suffers In-the Flesh shall cease 
from sin so yeah so this is a time that we have got 
to-return back now I know we're emphasizing prophetic 
things right now but folks-please know I I think I I speak 
for you too in the end this is all about the-message of the 
Gospel Jesus Christ and him crucified because in the end 
the-infallible word of God God the Bible trumps everything 
everything and the-gospel okay of the Lord Jesus Christ 
putting your faith in him with fruit of-repentance I think 
is the key uh to all of this and I think before we finish 
if-we can I think it'd be great if we prayed yes let's do 
it yeah I just I-just want to like I said like we just keep 
going over the Revival it C like-what you're saying when 
you look back at Auda Street it came out a very hard 
time-and it was coming out of uh uh uh you look at that you 
look at that you know-the there was other Revival that was 
the Welch Revival came out a hard time-there's a lot of 
revivals that came out of the voice of healing Revival from 
the-50s um the the tent revivals you're talking about a 
Oral Roberts uh that was-after World War II right but it 
was pressure and you-know it's and even with this America 
has been very blessed America has been a a-very Pros 
prosperous nation and a lot of people unless you touch 
what's what's-important to them you don't get their 
attention and a lot of the Mighty Dollar-having a bunch of 
money in your account and being able to do you get a hold 
of-that and you grab a hold of that and you start messing 
with that people go hold-on you got my attention real quick 
and so you know and I hate to say that but a-lot of times 
we don't need you know a lot of people say well we don't 
need God-until until times get hard and so there's going to 
be a humbling I really-believe that and there's going to be 
a time where people are going to have to-go it's time to 
wake up but it's for the church to be ready before yeah 
we're-supposed to be hearing him for what's coming that we 
have you know and I-believe and having stuff set aside for 
your family yes having things ready food-water electric you 
know something to for electric to charge your devices you 
know-if we're talking about these power outages we're 
talking about you know-maybe having a generator that's 
solar powered that you can charge your stuff-maybe or you 
know having things that are able to be able to be used 
during this-time from him so that you are able to be a 
helper in this that we're not the body-of Christ going ah 
yeah well you know we told you it was coming and we're 
not-prepared we're the Joseph's to have the storehouse that 
says listen and that's-why I believe if you're listening 
right now there will be a transfer of wealth-from the 
wicked there is a great harvest of finances for the body of 
Christ-during this time frame if you are listening to him 
he will tell you on-investments and things to do with your 
finances so that this will not be a-shock and awe to you 
that you were prepared to know what to do for you you-know 
whether what whatever that may be you know that you're 
hearing them they-going well I don't want to lose 
everything I don't want to lose-everything in the banks I 
don't want to do no it's not for if you're hearing 
him-God's Gonna prepare you just like he did Joseph but 
it's GNA take some fasting-and it's going to take some 
prayer and he'll tell you the secret-things amen all right 
well you want to start-out with prayer you want to 
absolutely father I thank you for my brother-Brandon I just
