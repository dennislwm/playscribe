today we're going to talk about the number one worst food 
for your-microbiome 80% of your immune system involves the 
microbiome and without-these microbes you cannot live they 
make vitamins they make neurotransmitters-that allow the 
brain to work correctly there's a huge influence between 
the-microbiome and your emotional state and it also is 
important for your immune-system and you also have a thin 
lining of cells that act as a barrier between-the inside of 
the body and the inside of your colon if any food stiff or 
microbes-get through that barrier then you start having an 
immune reaction you can start-developing allergies you 
could start developing autoimmune diseases and 
other-conditions especially on your skin and one big way 
that someone knows that they-have a problem with the 
microbiome is they get bloating diarrhea and I'm going-to 
give you some solutions if you have any problem with the 
microbiome but let-me first cover the seven worst things 
that you can be exposed to or consume-that ends up 
destroying your microbiome and the seventh one is the worst 
thing-number one industrial fibers it's made in some type 
of lab that are now-advertised as functional fibers like 
good for your body when in fact they're-not very good for 
your body and one would be actually the byproduct from 
the-lumber industry which someone had this crazy idea hey 
what are we going to do-with all this sawdust hey I have a 
great idea let's put it into the food supply-so basically 
turn saw AUST into this one fiber called cellulose so when 
you see-the word cellulose that is sawest usually and it's 
in a lot of foods too-like this one right here now the 
thing about cellulose is that we can't digest-it even our 
gut microbes also cannot digest it so some other fibers and 
again-we're not talking about vegetable fibers we're 
talking about things like cble-corn fiber or tapioca fiber 
here's a product um-at the store you can get that has 
resistant dextrin now what are the-problems with these 
fibers well number one they support pathogenic 
microbes-that cause more degrading of that mucus layer 
because you're basically feeding-the bad microbes that 
actually end up eating that mucus layer because 
that's-their food that's their protein Source all this 
Alters the microbiome and-eventually creates leaky gut 
number two emulsifiers now what's an emulsifier 
an-emulsifier is something to help mix two things together 
and this gives that food-a certain texture and that's so 
important especially if you're trying to-sell alter 
processed foods you have to make it mouth friendly one of 
the MiFi-believe it or not is maltodextrin I've talked 
about this in other videos-multidex is a type of 
carbohydrate that really spikes your blood sugars more-than 
sugar then you have something called zanthin gum and 
another one-called monoglyceride we're talking about 
the-vegetable seed oils right we're combining those in a 
way to help a mulfy-other ingredients so an example of 
something that would have that would be-right here Pringles 
after you buy this you know off the shelf it's been 
sitting-there for several months and you look at the chip 
and it still looks fresh it-maintains its crunchiness 
another good example of emulsifier would be 
something-called propylene glycol that's an ingredient also 
in antifreeze but they-put in the food supply as well but 
what's the problem with these-emulsifiers well number one 
they disrupt the microbiome in your gut they also-disrupt 
the wall that is your barrier in your gut potentially 
leading to-inflammation and a hole through that wall called 
leaky gut they also alter-the diversity of microbes which 
can then lead to an increased risk of metabolic-syndrome 
and pre-diabetes insulin resistance ETC number three 
very-specific types of proteins gluten in wheat which by 
the way gluten is the-only protein that our bodies cannot 
digest we also have uh casine which is-the protein in milk 
and then we have the protein in soy as in soy 
protein-isolates they're industrial proteins and they 
create a lot of gut inflammation a-lot of people are either 
allergic to casine and gluten as well as soy the-thing 
about the soy is it's high in Fates and Fates have 
Inhibitors of-enzymes so when you're consuming all this soy 
protein isolate you're-inhibiting your ability to digest 
certain things and what's going to-happen is not just 
bloating in your colon you're probably going to 
notice-problems on your skin and that's how they coming 
from the gut of course you-go to a dermatologist and what 
are they going to do they're going to topically-treat it 
with some steroid cream they're going to not make the 
connection between-things going on in your gut and then 
you're chronically just going to have-that problem number 
four seed oils okay this is huge it's in a lot of our 
Foods-it's highly inflammatory so it's going to create 
inflammation in your gut-eventually leading to leaky gut 
where now certain pathogens and certain foods-are going to 
invade the body there's going to be an immune reaction and 
a-potential allergy or an autoimmune issue I used to 
consume so much seed oil when-I was in college and in my 
early 20s that I was constantly bloating and of-course I 
knew nothing about nutrition or healthy foods at all it's 
pretty weird-to look back on how much I did not know about 
health I mean I was like my worst-patient I was actually 
worse than my worst patient I always had abdominal-pain and 
a Severe uh sludge of bile that was backing up into my 
liver because I-always had right shoulder pain more than a 
decade and I had that even back in-high school really bad I 
had no idea I thought it was muscular but it was all-diet 
number five the refined sugars high fructose corn syrup and 
also the refined-starches okay like maltodextrin modified 
food starch it's in all these Foods it's-especially in 
foods like this one right here which I used to live on now 
here's-the problem with these refined sugars H fructose 
corn syrup and the starches not-just to spike and blood 
sugars but they create rapid fermentation so the-microbes 
in your gut are rapidly breaking down this sugar because 
it's so-refined and you're going to have a lot of things 
like gas bloating and a Severe-spike in the number of 
pathogens so when you eat refined sugar you basically 
feed-the bad guys and you starve off the good guys number 
six the sugar alcohols the-sugar alcohols are in uh things 
like the so-called ketofriendly-bars and the ketofriendly 
drinks this has nothing to do with-alcohol it's just a type 
of sweetener that is supposed to not raise your blood-sugar 
but this one does called mtol it's the worst it's in a lot 
of sugar-free-candy like this one right here I don't know 
if you've ever seen this product-right here stay away from 
that that's pretty much worse than even eating 
sugar-because it's going to create a lot of bloating it's 
going to raise your blood-sugars I don't I don't even know 
why it's a sugar alcohol a much better sugar-alcohol would 
be a rol combined with monk fruit or Stevia allulose is 
not-necessarily sugar alcohol but it's a better alternative 
sweetener but the-point is that if you consume a lot of 
these sugar alcohols because you're-consuming these 
so-called ketofriendly products you're going to get a lot 
of-gas bloating diarrhea it just might be a good idea to 
learn from other people's-mistakes before I get to number 
seven I just to mention there are other things-that greatly 
destroy your microbiome that aren't necessarily foods 
like-alcohol antibiotics chlorine which is a chemical in 
water an herbicide-glyphosate now when researching this 
topic two things kept coming up red meat-and number two 
saturated fats but when you pull the string behind where 
these-two recommendations come from they're from rat 
studies and a lot of these rat-studies the fat that they're 
using is corn oil which is unsaturated it's not-saturated 
so it's it's very confusing and to my knowledge there is no 
study-that shows that consuming like healthy saturated fats 
from grass-fed meat for-example has any negative aspects 
for your gut in fact I think it's just the-reverse because 
the way that a lot of people heal their guts is with 
the-carnivore diet when you see things like avoid red meat 
or saturated fat they're-probably talking about processed 
Meats maybe the saturated fats in junk food-they're not 
talking about the grass-fed meats or the healthy eggs or 
the healthy-cheese I mean even in like this junk food right 
here there's not a lot of-saturated fat it's seed oils it's 
a lot of unsaturated fat in alter processed-food next one 
is number seven artificial sweeteners I'm not talking about 
sugar-alcohols I'm talking about like aspartame sucrose 
things like that these-artificial sweeteners have been used 
by millions of people for years little do-we know that 
these artificial sweeteners create a big problem for a 
microbiome-they actually have the ability to change the 
relationship of your microbes being-friendly or neutral to 
now unfriendly let's take the eoli bacteria eoli is-really 
a neutral or a friendly microbe we have eoli in our guts 
when you-consume artificial sweeteners these eoli become 
unfriendly and they become-pathogenic this is going to 
start creating an immune reaction we also get-less 
fermentation which makes less food for your colon cells 
overall this-artificial sweetener creates a huge shift I 
also noticed some people that-chronically consume 
artificial sweeteners as in diet sodas that type of-thing 
end up having kind of either a red nose or red cheeks that 
is an alteration-in the gut microbes now if you have a 
problem with your gut microbiome you-should start taking 
probiotics and on a regular basis and see if that 
doesn't-handle the problem if things get worse it could 
mean that you have severe-inflammation in your gut in which 
case you'd probably benefit from doing the-carnivore diet 
for a while so you can heal your gut with the carnivore 
diet-you're going to eliminate so many things that irritate 
and Destroy and create-inflammation in the gut lining so if 
you have some type of skin rash or-inflammation things are 
going to get a lot better if you want more 
information-about that topic you should watch this video
