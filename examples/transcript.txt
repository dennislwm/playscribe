hey everyone Chris Jer and today I'd like to show you orb 
STC a brand new-Fast light and Powerful way to run 
containers and VMS on Mac OS with OP-stack you can say 
bye-bye to Docker desktop and to other programs 
like-virtual box because it is so much better and faster 
than all of them so let's get-into it I'm going to talk a 
bit about the program explain what it makes-different than 
all of the other tools and we'll also have a look at some 
of-the unique features for deploying containers and VMS on 
Mac like the-simulus integration of file sharing and the 
network stack as well as the-kubernetes integration 
automatic https certificates for local deployments and-some 
other cool stuff that you will love as a tech nerd trust me 
so yeah Tech-nerds like us we love software that helps us 
to do our day-to-day work and I-quickly want to show you 
another nice tool which I know those of you who work-in it 
will absolutely love because if you're managing resources 
and assets in-a company you know this is a big challenge 
especially if the company has-hundreds of thousands of 
servers network devices applications and other assets-this 
is exactly where fatom comes into play the sponsor of 
today's video Fatam-is a platform that discovers and maps 
all your it infrastructure like servers-and business 
applications within minutes no matter if it's on premise or 
in the-cloud and it's one of the fastest Solutions in the 
market that solves the-challenge of understanding how a 
change of your infrastructure will impact your-business and 
I it operations fom has many amazing features but one thing 
that-I believe stands out from the rest is that it 
discovers all the assets-entirely by itself and it groups 
them into business applications completely-agentless and it 
also does continuous it documentation that is fully 
Dynamic-which is super cool because documentation in it is 
so freaking-important and hard to do as well you can use it 
for many practical use cases such-as change management 
impact analysis cmdb Cloud Migra-data center transformation 
drbc cyber security and many more and it starts-with an 
entry-level self-service speed boats plan which allows you 
to manage-100 servers for 10 grand annually which is by the 
way a fair deal in a market-fied with other notoriously 
expensive tools it also has a 14 days trial where-there is 
no sales call needed so just check it out and start 
managing your it-infrastructure dependencies like a pro of 
course you will find a link to it in-the description of the 
video all right so let's learn more about the-program orst 
you can find all the information on the official website 
or.-Def and there you can see the developers position this 
as some sort of-replacement for Docker desktop so it's a 
light fast and easy way to run-containers on your local Mac 
device as well as some Linux virtual machines but-we will 
also have a look at this in a few minutes the cool thing 
about this-program is once you install it you don't have to 
learn an entirely new system so-all the commands you know 
from Docker as well as the docker file and everything-just 
works the same way in OBC it just replaces the layer of how 
the containers-are managed on your system by the way if you 
want to learn-more about the architecture opst also has 
some great documentation that-explains it in a bit more 
detail so how the containers and VMS are managed on-the Mac 
and why it is faster you can see those surfaces are written 
in a mixture-of Swift go rust and c and it does have some 
pretty optimizations and features-that allow this 
application to act much faster than dock or desktop and it 
also-comes with some additional cool features that are very 
interesting for developers-like file sharing custom Dynamic 
hashing and optimization to provide a fast bind-Mount 
points and access to the Mac files and it also does have 
some very-interesting networking features I will also show 
you in a bit more detail and-it's also written with 
security in mind you can also find some speed metrics 
on-the website to actually see how much faster it is than 
darker desktop so for-example if you buil a darker 
container on darker desktop that would take 19-minutes on 
orb stack it's doing the same task in just 7 minutes and it 
also-doesn't take as much CPU power and a battery 
consumption from your Mac so-when you are working with a 
MacBook Pro for example and you're developing-containers 
for kubernetes or Docker or St is just the better 
technology that-will not drain so much battery and you can 
do all the things in a much more-efficient way to install 
opst on your local Mac just click on get obst and-then you 
can download the application and go through the 
installation-procedure or you can put this on line command 
in your terminal if you're using-Homebrew Homebrew is just 
a great application on Mac OS and that is-automatically 
installed it by the way also runs alongside with Docker 
desktop-so you don't need to worry about Docker desktop 
being replaced or anything being-damaged Ops that can even 
migrate all the containers you're running on Docker-desktop 
two ARB stack as well with all of the networks and volumes 
attached to-them so it's very very simple and easy if you 
open the application you can see-on the left side you have 
a menu for browsing your containers your volumes-your 
images as I can see I currently don't have any running 
containers but-there is a quick example of how you can do 
this so let's just copy the command-run this and then we 
can open the Local Host in my browser and yeah here we 
are-that's our container that we have just deployed and it 
just took about a-millisecond and when you have a few 
containers running on your Mac you can-also inspect the 
lock file search for something you can delete the locks 
or-you open a terminal directly inside the running 
container where you can do some-administrative tasks access 
files whatever you want to do with it and if-you click on 
the files menu it also opens the finder where you can see 
all-the files in the container just on your local Mac file 
browser so it couldn't be-easier than than that and if you 
want to run kubernetes you-can also turn on kubernetes and 
it automatically starts deploying a very-lightweight 
kubernetes cluster on your local Mac device so there you 
can see if-you go to Containers there is a new drop down 
menu for kubernetes where it-already deployed the core DNS 
the local path provisioner so that is necessary to-run 
kubernetes and then you can start deploying your manifest 
or experiment-with Helm charts and just use your local Mac 
as a testing kubernetes clust to-develop applications in a 
container orchestration layer one thing that might-be 
interesting is you can see on the uh bottom left corner you 
can see there's a-pro version and trial that ends in seven 
days so you can see there is a paid-option for OPC but if 
we go back to the website and go to pricing you can 
see-there's also a free tier for personal non-commercial 
use and this you can use-to run containers run Linux 
machines without any limitations or something-like that if 
you need a business and Commercial usage license and you 
want-some additional features then you have to buy a pro 
license or an Enterprise-license but honestly I think if 
you're just a home lab tech nerd like me and-and you just 
want to run a few containers on your local Mac 
or-experiment with kubernetes and a few VMS then the free 
personal license is-totally sufficient so that's what I'm 
also using I just still have the Pro-trial but when it's 
expiring I'm just using the free plan-but let's also take a 
look at some of the special features in opst that I-believe 
make it even better than Docker desktop or some other 
competitive-programs like pman desktop I think this is 
really really nice for all the people-that work with web 
applications in Docker or want to learn how traffic 
and-load balancing works it's really really amazing so when 
we go to the-architecture and documentation page you can 
see there are some pretty cool-features especially the 
domain name features so you can see that orb stack-doesn't 
just work with the Local Host so what I've just 
demonstrated in this-example it also runs a domain name 
that is called ar. local so this is really-nice to test web 
applications you don't need any port numbers for web 
services-so if you have a darker container that uses the 
port 3000 you can basically-just ignore it because arst 
automatically detects what port the web-application is 
using and then it automatically routes the traffic to 
that-particular port and it also issues secure 
https-certificates for those services so you really don't 
need to test any sech-manager traffic or something like 
that you can really test web applications in-a very secure 
way on your local device it's pretty cool for example if 
you uh-want to run an engine X web servers with trusted TLS 
certificates testing here on-op stack you can just use uh 
that example here uh let's go to my project-folder and 
let's open this and create a new-darker compost file paste 
in that and now this is just-deploying a simple engine X 
web server you could also add labels for custom-domains so 
for example if you want to have something like enginex test 
one.-local this is totally fine we can just go here and 
start the compos stack now-if we go back to or stack you 
can see there is a new compos project so darker-compos 
projects are also indicated with a drop- down project 
folder and here-when we go to this container you can see 
that it attaches the enginex test. one.-loal domain to it 
so when we just click on this it opens the browser to 
our-enginex website and as you can see it also has an https 
connection with-trusted TLS certificates really really 
amazing you don't need to configure-anything or trust any 
self-signed certificates in your browser it's-automatically 
done in ARB St again I love this feature so much because 
I-often have web applications that I like to test on my 
device and now this is so-easy there's also an amazing 
integration for the kubernetes cluster in opst deck-so for 
example if you want to test and expose service objects in 
kubernetes for-web services or you want to play around with 
Ingress controllers and load-balancers like traffic or 
engine X this is also really easy and greatly-integrated in 
obst for example you have a domain that is automatically 
attached-to any load balancer Services you deploy to the 
local cluster and you can also-easily access any cluster IP 
addresses from your local Mac so to demonstrate-this for 
example we can just deploy a simple engine X to get access 
to the OBS-kuber this cluster you just switch your config 
to use ARB stack and then you can-just use the cube CDL 
command it's also integrated in the installation of 
ARB-stack so you automatically have all the CLI features 
that you need-and here you can see there are all the 
containers that are currently running on-my local cluster 
so if we now want to deploy a new engine X image so 
for-example let's create a new namespace called engine X 
and deploy it here now-we also need a service object so I'm 
going to use the type cluster IP for now-so this is usually 
only available and accessible within the local network 
of-kubernetes so you can simply just copy the internal 
cluster IP op and open it-in the web browser and then 
immediately get access to the port deployed in-kubernetes 
by just accessing the local IP address if we open or stack 
and go to-Services you can see this is a service object for 
the partt that we have-attached it to and here you can also 
find the domain for the cluster so this-is usually the 
service name the name space service object cluster. local 
and-then you can access it by name as well if you want TLS 
certific ific Ates and-test Ingress controllers this is 
also possible very easily so if we go back to-the 
documentation you can see you can choose from an engine X 
Ingress-controller or traffic so if we quickly want to 
deploy traffic to this cluster-we can also do it by just 
copying those commands here those load balancer-service 
objects in orb kubernetes also get a different domain that 
is called-ks. or. looc a wildcard domain that you can use 
to test the traffic Ingress-controller you can also 
automatically access it in your browser and then you-can 
try the Ingress controller you can play around with it and 
try exposing-cluster IP objects using traffic I think this 
is really really nice where you-want to test some exposing 
of services some certificate management Ingress-controllers 
and all that stuff it's really amazing but let us also have 
a-look at the integration of virtual machines in arst where 
you can run fully-blown Linux machines but in a highly 
integrated and very lightweight way so-when you go to the 
documentation you can see this is pretty similar to 
the-windows subsystem for Linux so it would be something 
like a Mac subsystem for-Linux where you can just run any 
services in those virtual machines where-you can access 
them from your Mech also using the Local Host domain and 
you can-also have immediate access to any files on your Mac 
inside the virtual machine-but let me just show it to you 
it's also pretty nice so you can just go through-the web UI 
click on new machine and deploy a new Ubuntu machine or 
choose a-any other Linux distribution like Arch Linux 
sentos Debian and some other Linux-dis that you might want 
to try out you choose the version that you want and if-you 
want the CPU type apple or the Intel emulation layer with 
Rosetta so this-also works great to test a try out x86 
architectured uh application on your Mac-it's pretty cool 
and it's also really really fast the emulation layer in 
Mac-OS runs runs also very very fast fast but I'm going to 
choose the Apple CPU-type which is even faster I create the 
machine and now it's going to install a-new Ubuntu 24.4 on 
my Mac so this probably just-takes a few seconds so it's 
not even taking a minute or so and then the-virtual machine 
should be ready for us and you can immediately access this 
VM-from your terminal when you just use the ARP command so 
you can see the VM is now-ready installed and you can 
easily access all the files using this and uh-yeah then you 
got the full virtual machine file system on your-Mac and 
yeah let's just type in ARP in the terminal and then you 
got access to-the VM it's also as easy as that and as you 
can see this automatically gets me-access to all the local 
files on my Mac from the Linux VM so it's really similar-to 
wsl2 where the virtual machine is highly integrated into 
the operating-system and you can access the files vice 
versa and easily run any Linux-applications so for example 
if we want to run a python script but I don't want-to run 
the python script on my Mac I want to test how it would run 
on a Linux-VM I can just use the ARB command and then type 
in any command uh after that-that will automatically be 
executed in the virtual machine so for example if we-just 
run a simple python script that will open a web server on 
Port 8000-guess what happens when we type in the name of 
the virtual machine Ubuntu ar.-local Port 8000 you can see 
you get immediate access to the web application-running in 
virtual machine from your Mac without having to Route any 
network-ports or without having to remember an internal IP 
address or anything like-this it just magically works by 
using the name of the virtual machine. or.-local and then 
the port you want to access on the virtual machine and 
yeah-this is so simp and it is so nice integrated so you 
can easily test and-run any Linux applications on your Mac 
you can develop stuff you can test it-and if you don't need 
it anymore well you can simply just destroy it when you-go 
back to orst and stop it delete it and it's as easy as that 
all right so-that's it about orb stack I think it is 
absolutely amazing and it will be my-daily driver on Mac to 
run containers and VM from now on it has been 
super-reliable and easy to use but of course I I know love 
to hear your opinion about-it so please let me know what do 
you think about opack leave a comment down-below and as 
always thanks everyone for watching I'm going to catch you 
in the-next video so take care bye-bye
