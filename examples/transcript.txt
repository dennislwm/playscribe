hi everyone my name is Colton Carnival I am the COO here at 
fast grafts I work-with the development team and everything 
and yeah I wanted to thank you guys all-for attending today 
we're going to be going over what fast graphs is who 
it's-really targeted for who can really take advantage of 
it and and show some-features and really show how to use 
the tool at the bottom of your Zoom you-should see a little 
button that says Q&A so at any point in time you guys 
can-type in answers or questions there and throughout this 
webinar we'll we'll try-and answer all of them some of them 
may be directly answered some of them may be-answered 
through stuff that I'm already going through so at any 
point in time-feel free to do that but let's go ahead and 
get started so I will share my-screen and yeah get started 
so first things first who is fast graphs really-for right 
so fast graphs is really built for the the long-term 
fundamental-investor it works because it's focused on the 
business behind the stock and the-price second where 
traditionally most other websites that you're looking 
at-for stock research you are you're looking at Price first 
and we like I-said focus on the fundamentals of a business 
first and what I will do here-in a minute is go through 
what we're seeing on this chart and show you how we-do that 
but within seconds you can see if a stock is even worth 
looking into as-an investment candidate it's really really 
really shortens your investment-time that you have to syn 
into your research when looking at stocks I can I-can 
quickly go through a bunch of stocks and almost instantly 
look at them and be-like it's not really even worth my time 
to to dive into the financials even more-or the 10ks the 10 
Qs that type of stuff which is which is all stuff that 
you-have to do but you can waste a lot of time without a 
tool like Fast graphs-fast stands for fundamental analyzer 
software tools so once again we are-we're really focused on 
the fundamentals of the business earnings determine-market 
price where the earnings go the stock price is going to 
follow but it-also represents that the fast in fast grafts 
represents how fast it can speed-up your your research 
process when investing in stocks so let's take a look-at a 
at some charts we're going to take a look at some companies 
uh some good-ones some bad ones to describe what I've been 
talking about but first I want to-take a look at this we're 
going to kind of pull apart what we're seeing on the-screen 
and then yeah go from there so I can take all of these 
lines off on the-chart and at first I know it can be 
daunting but once you really figure out-what the lines mean 
it's it's super easy but I want to just start with with 
price-which everybody's used to right so if you go to other 
websites for stock-research you're going to see price 
movement that's what everybody's focused-on should I have 
bought here after it dropped dropped should I bought 
here-after it dropped should I bought here after it dropped 
is this overpriced is-this overpriced you never really know 
unless you're really looking at the-fundamentals of the 
business and once again that's what fast graphs shows 
you-so by clicking on this fair value ratio down here I can 
plot what we call the-fair value ratio and so we calculate 
a fair value ratio of a 15 times earnings-based on the 
growth rate of the company and as growth rates change the 
fair-value changes and I can change shorten time frames I 
can increase time length-in time frames I can use this down 
here and then notice as I'm changing time-frames this 
growth rate has gone up to a 1629 which then has given me a 
16.2 n-fair value right if I drag this back here and I'm 
looking at a 9.2 it's-giving me a 15 times fair value and 
what that means-is we're plotting adjusted earnings per 
share so you actually get a whole-plethora of metrics to 
work with but right now we're plotting adjusted-operating 
earnings adjusted EPS each fiscal year and what we have 
done is we-apply this 15 times multiple to every single one 
of these right so this 8.52-that we that we see right here 
this represents that at 8.52 * 15 this is-8.85 * 15 11 * 15 
and so on and then what we do cuz like I said we focus 
on-the fundamentals of the business first we put the stock 
price on top of it now-as you can see where the business 
goes the stock price goes in the long run-right this is 20 
years of data that we're looking at okay so there's 
going-to be short-term volatility there's going to be times 
where it's not exactly-on the Orange Line times where it's 
over times where it's under-extended periods of time where 
it's under and sometimes we'll see stocks-where it is over 
the Orange Line many times or for long periods Scott 
Richard-just asked a question when you say fair value is it 
normalized PE based on-growth EPS estimates to get fair 
value via multiplication Scott I don't-necessarily 
understand what you're asking there but in simplistic terms 
the-way that we calculate fair value is we calculate the 
compound annual growth-rate of the time that we're looking 
at based on the metric that we're looking-at and based off 
of that growth rate we use a few different formulas which 
you-guys can read in our learning section in our Learning 
Center that calculate that-fair value ratio so I hope that 
answers your question we do have forecasting as-well which 
I will get to in a minute so in really simplistic terms 
when I'm-looking at a at a historical chart that's what 
this chart is called right-here anytime it's under the 
orange line it's undervalued anytime it's over the-orange 
line it's overvalued now that doesn't mean you can't make 
money right-buying something overvalued but what 
overvaluation represents is risk right a-stock can be 
extremely overvalued and keep going up especially in the 
short-term as people are pumping money into it as people 
are super excited about that-stock but at some point it 
probably will fall you can never say it's going to-fall for 
sure but what you are doing is you are extending yourself 
and you are-buying in to a lot of risk and so this little 
blip over here right this you-could argue is overvalue but 
that doesn't mean you can't buy it and one-thing I can do 
is I can left click here and then left click anywhere on 
the-price line and see a growth rate right so if it were if 
I were to have bought-it then and then held it out till 
here I would have gotten a-13.55% annualized percent or 
annualized rate of return okay I would have turned-$10,000 
into $29,000 now this is where valuation-really becomes 
important overvalued versus undervalued if I would 
have-waited a few years first of all I would have had to 
have gone through about a-year and a half of losses losing 
23% total or 17.64% per year before I-started to rece to 
see that return but if I would have waited a few years 
till-it was undervalued to buy this and I'm going to choose 
a bottom and go till our-last closing price I would have 
had 21% annualized rate of return so I would-have turned 
$10,000 into 41,9 124 that's a huge difference right-like 
what did what was the comparison it was-$41,000 versus oops 
let me get one versus-$31,000 right so $10,000 more dollars 
I made off of my investment in a year and-a half less time 
that's due to buying a good valued company that is growing 
fast-right so I want to take a look at a couple other 
companies this is elevance-right here this is a a managed 
healthc care company that's the sub industry-over here I 
guess before I do that let me let me show a few more 
portions of-what we're looking at over here so we have on 
the side here called what we-call fast packs okay and if 
you're on a smaller screen you may see it below okay-but on 
on normal size screens on larger screens it's going to be 
to the right-but what this represents is we've got some 
information regarding the stocks or-previous clothes the 
Blended PE which the Blended PE is something that 
we-specifically use here at fast graphs it's a mix between 
the trailing and the-forward PE we like to use a blended PE 
ratio because we we think it represents-a more current 
valuation of the stock if you use a trailing PE then you're 
using-historical data that that's not not the current 
earnings of the company if-you're using forecasting data so 
a forward PE forecasting data is not-guaranteed to be 
correct so you can be overstating or misjudging what the 
PE-Ratio is but what we do is we take a blended average 
between the last actual-and the nearest forecasting data 
point so that would mean I'm taking a PE ratio-between this 
33.1 14 and this 37.25 estimate number and coming up with-a 
PE ratio time weighted average based off of that then down 
here we have the-graph key so this is representing the 
growth rate of that orange line that we-see the fair value 
ratio is this 15 right here so that is the the actual-what 
ratio this orange line is plotted at and then we also have 
this thing-that's called the normal PE so the normal PE is 
what the market has-normally traded this stock at okay so I 
can see that this is traded normally at-a 4 14 times 
multiple instead of a 15 that's due to these many years 
right-here of it being under the orange line if I were to 
shorten this we can see it-slightly over okay that's due to 
these time periods being slightly over the way-that we 
calculate that normal PE is it's the fiscal year end pees 
trimmed the-average of the fiscal year end pees trimmed for 
a high and a low and then if-it gets below five years we 
just do the we we don't do any trimming so it's just-the 
the average of the fiscal year npes but so this then gives 
you an idea of-what the market has normally traded it at 
right because there can be times-where based on the growth 
rate we're calculating a lower PE ratio but it may-never 
have hit that PE ratio so we also Supply this normal PE 
line so you can-say okay over the last 20 years this is 
what this stock has normally traded at-and if it's 
significantly over that blue line and over the orange line 
I mean-you're kind of looking at a clear picture of of 
overvaluation in that-sense so that's that's why we include 
that blue line then I have a few other-things on here we 
have two forms like two ways that we show dividends we 
show-a dividend payout ratio line okay so that's plotting 
this dollar1-15150 at the same ratio as this and what this 
represents is actually the payout-ratio so I can see that 
this is 17.6% payout ratio right here that line right-here 
is roughly 17.6% this Orange Line basically and we-can see 
that over here a little bit better so this company's 
maintaining a-17 to 16 to 177% payout ratio on their 
dividends and we'll see in other-companies that's going to 
be a lot higher you instantly see the payout-ratios with 
fast grabs right boom right there on the chart we then also 
showed-the dividends as this green shaded area above the 
orange line to represent you-as a shareholder you're 
getting a participation in the earnings and then-your 
dividends on top of that so that's what that green shaded 
area represents-on top of that you can also plot a dividend 
yield okay so as the stock-price is lower the dividend is 
higher as the stock price gets higher in terms of-valuation 
the dividend yield gets lower okay so couple different 
lines that you-can throw on here you can take them off if 
you want and so on so let's take a-look at a couple other 
companies I want to show you guys a company that is a-good 
low Growth Company so we can see stability and earnings 
here right this-this orange line is is not really wavy 
right like it's it's growing at a solid-rate I can see the 
change per year down here they had a high growth 177% 
this-year then 1% 8% 8% a little bit of drop there post 
recession so this is the-2008 recession the the big housing 
recession that we had and then this-other gray shaded area 
represents the co recession but as we can all see this is-a 
relatively stable but solid grower this has only grown 
at-4.07% compared to that 13 to 16% that we saw with 
elevance that last company as-we can see I can plot the 
stock price on top of this and over the long run this-stock 
price follows where this company goes now there's times of 
overvaluation-and Times of of undervaluation right so we 
have some undervaluation back here we-have some 
overvaluation up here but it tends to always return to the 
mean and-this is another picture of a company that I may 
want to invest in now also-take a look at the dividend 
payout ratio I can instantly see that this payout-ratio is 
higher than elanes right I can instantly see they pay more 
in dividends-than elevance and they're paying around it 63 
64% payout ratio so once again-instant looks into like 
what's going on with the company potential Investments-what 
you could be getting out of it as an investor let's look at 
a company now-where it is kind of bad in no growth and I'm 
going to take the stock price off so-this is a company 
where their earnings were good back through 2009 and 
now-they've started losing money all throughout these years 
and to No-Surprise the stock price is dropped that whole 
time right so I can instantly see-this is not a company I 
would want to invest in there's a difference in stock-price 
drops there's this stock price drop is driven completely by 
the-fundamentals of the company deteriorating and I can 
instantly see-that there's no there's no question about it 
I there's no research I have to-do I'm visually seeing all 
this so fast and that's what makes fast graphs 
really-really powerful another company that we can look at 
this is just another ugly-company we're going to see 
cyclicality and earnings okay and what does-everybody think 
the stock price is going to do when I plot it basically 
follows-it this company has gone nowhere they had this boom 
in earnings up till 2008-and then we saw a huge crash in 
the stock price and it stayed relatively-flat since this is 
dead money this is a decade or more of just dead money 
that-fast grafts can help you avoid right like we all want 
to make money we all-want to make safer Investments and 
fast grafts is really here to help you make-sa safer 
investment decisions one more company I want to show you 
guys is SMG-and we can see that there's some cyclicality in 
this company we had some-drops down here bit back up a boom 
back in in earnings here and then a collapse-in earnings 
and what's stock price do it follows it right we aren't 
making this-fit we are purely calcul ating what we think is 
a fair value ratio based on the-growth rate and it is 
undeniable that the stock price follows where 
those-earnings go okay cyclical companies you'll see 
cyclical stock prices you-want to see another cyclical 
company caterpillar is one for example here's-cyclicality I 
can instantly see that this company is a cyclical company 
just-off the earnings what's the stock price do it follows 
it I mean it almost-follows it to a te right there is 
disconnects there's always going to be-disconnects 
short-term disconnects but in the long run we can see that 
let's-see someone asked where can I see free cash flow for 
covering the dividend-there's actually two spots that you 
can see that so in the list of metrics that-we have we have 
free cash flow we have operating cash flow sales EIT ebit 
so if-I just click this we're looking at free cash flow 
here's a point where free cash-flow hasn't covered the 
dividend here's another point but all throughout 
these-years they cover it we can also go to the fiscal 
Fitness which this is a a-section that gives you some 
pre-built charts operating cash flow growth share-BuyBacks 
operating cash flow greater than net income and I can see 
on here-that free cash flow for the most part is covering 
the the dividends someone just-asked fast grafts is endof 
day data what time does it update so we update as soon-as 
we get data from our data provider we do actually offer 
International stocks-so with a Bas plan we offer us and 
Canadian stocks which is roughly-covering 20,000 equities 
and then when we if you were to buy the international-data 
plan that jumps it to about 80 to 990,000 for US Stocks I 
would say-roughly at by 5: pm. Eastern Standard time we 
have loaded in most of the-unofficial pricing and then we 
get the total like complete official pricing-sometime by 
midnight but and what that means unofficial means is is 
that it can-change they're making sure I guess that that 
data is correct but most of the-times it's not going to 
change but unofficial pricing comes in 
relatively-relatively quick and then as for fundamental 
data we get fundamental data-we get new estimates all 
throughout the day so we're constantly loading 
data-whenever we can get whenever we get data from our data 
provider whenever they-upload data to their system is when 
we pull it so it's it's intermittently it's-throughout the 
day but yeah so end of day stock price data does 
come-relatively fast into the system Okay so we've covered 
a few companies good ones-bad ones how fast you can really 
view what these companies look like with fast-graphs right 
well one thing that I want to cover now is the metrics that 
you can-look at right so I can look at for all these 
companies I can look at tons of-different metrics plotting 
all of these eida ebit sales right these are all-available 
for use for valuation purpos some companies are going to 
look better-on some metrics and some companies than other 
companies like if I go to Amazon-for example and we're 
looking at adjusted operating earnings we see this-massive 
disconnect I can take this off and I can say okay well 
that's never-tracked operating earnings right but if I go 
to operating cash flow this company-tracks operating cash 
flow to a T So as an example Chuck Carnaval the CEO of-fast 
graphs he always says this is a tool to think with so we 
give you the-things the data to look at and you can kind of 
put together pictures of-valuation by using all of these 
metrics a major question that we get is what is-the best 
metric to use and this isn't us being snarky or anything 
our best answer-is use all of them right I mean it's so 
fast I can just click through all of-these really fast and 
see different pictures of the company I 
wouldn't-necessarily go through them this fast I'd take a 
little bit of time and and-take a look at like Amazon sales 
are really smooth right that's that's-instant data I see 
right there boom really smooth fast growing sales that's-a 
that's a great thing to see in in a company generates a ton 
of operating-cash flow boom right there already that fast 
and once again that's what's so-powerful about fast grafts 
we do have this one thing right here called a smart-metric 
so as I look at different companies notice that it 
keeps-defaulting to adjusted operating earnings even though 
I was on operating-cash flow and then if I were to look at 
a company like a Reit it's actually-going to default to 
adjusted funds from operations now if I were to click 
this-off and change it to eida for example I can now search 
for other companies and-it's going to stay on eida but this 
smart metric just kind of helps speed up-the investment 
process there okay now that we've kind of gone through 
the-historical chart and all of this I want to take a look 
at some of the other-functions that we have available on 
the tool we have this chart this section-called the 
performance section and what this allows you to do is 
compare stocks-the growth rate of stocks all of that to up 
to three comparison tickers right now-I have it being 
compared to the Spy I'm going to get into what these charts 
are-in a second I can see down here that these are my 
performance results if I-were to invested $10,000 into 
Johnson and Johnson this would have been my-starting price 
my ending price how much I invested my beginning shares 
ending-shares and then I get a performance result down here 
comparing the two-Investments so over that same time frame 
the amount of dividends the growth like-the Capital Growth 
so my annualized growth without dividends total and 
then-total annualized rate of return I also get some 
dividend performance stuff down-here so I can see that on 
average Johnson and Johnson grows their dividend-faster 
than the spy and then compound and average growth rate they 
growing it-much faster than spy y then I can also come down 
here I can see all of the-dividends being paid out for 
Johnson and Johnson I can quickly go in between-summary 
detail I can also put newest and oldest swapping those 
things now back to-this chart I want to choose a different 
company I want to go back to elevance by-the way you can 
click up here you can left click or I'm clicking the 
forward-slash the thing just below the question mark on my 
keyboard and that also lets-me open this up and type up 
here without taking my hands off with keyboard but I-want 
to take a look at elevance and show you guys what this 
chart is really-showing us so once again fast graphs 
focuses on fundamentals first earnings-determine market 
price the fundamentals of the company are going to 
ultimately-determine the return of the investment in the 
long run okay so what we do is on-this performance chart 
we're not just focusing on price we focus on price and-then 
also the change the cumulative change of the metric that 
we're looking-at so if I was looking at operating cash flow 
notice this has also changed to-operating cash flow for 
both elevance and the Spy I'm going to go back to-adjusted 
EPS for this case now what we do is we show the cumulative 
change of-the Spy versus elevance from a EPS standpoint and 
a price standpoint so I-can see if I take these apart that 
elevance has significantly outperformed-the Spy in terms of 
return right can also hit this and change this to-compound 
annual growth rate so I'm looking at a 13.64% compound 
annual-growth rate versus an 8.03 huge difference right and 
why well if I plot-the earnings of both of these I can see 
that the earnings of elevance has-significantly outperform 
the earnings of the Spy the growth rate right and 
it's-stable it's growing super stable stable and there's no 
question really at this-point as to why elevance has grown 
more it's because the company has grown-faster than the Spy 
has so that stock price has reflected it this chart 
down-here then is also comparing valuation in conjunction 
with this price change-because price change is a form of a 
few things right if it were to go from-undervalued to 
overvalued it's going to have a compounded effect on that 
price-change whether just like if it goes from overvalued 
to undervalued it's going to-have a dampening effect on 
that price change so what we plot is the fair value-ratio 
which is the flat dotted lines right here right so I have 
two fair-value ratios which based on the growth rates of 
the earnings the spy and-elevance both have the same one 
and then I'm plotting the Pees here as well okay-so we can 
see a massive tick in PE ratio for the Spy while elevance 
has also seen-that right during this time frame but it went 
from undervalued to roughly fairly-valued while the Spy has 
basically gone massively overvalued and then we saw a-big 
drop whereas we've seen elevance down here kind of 
maintaining around its-fair value and once again we can see 
that right here right so we can see that-it's rotating 
around its fair value line we can take a look at a company 
like-Cisco okay so this would be this is a perfect-example 
of why you need to also compare valuation at the same time 
if we take a-look at the Cisco price and the Spy price spy 
has outperformed Cisco but if-I look at the EPS growth of 
this Cisco has significantly outperformed the Spy-EPS 
growth 7.28 versus 10% right but why has Cisco 
underperformed then why do it-underperformed the SP why why 
is it not followed that earnings growth it's-because Cisco 
was significantly overvalued back here in 2003 and it's-now 
come down in 2023 and 2024 back to fair value okay we can 
see that on the-historical chart we can see this massive 
overvaluation okay even though this-company was growing 
extremely fast at this point in time 23% a year if you-were 
to invest in this company over this time frame you would 
made 3.22% per year-why because of overvaluation okay so 
valuation is super super important and-this Performance 
Tool helps you understand what is also causing 
that-performance to be affected positively or negatively 
the next thing that I want to-take a look at is the 
forecasting tool I'm going to go back to elevance this 
is-kind of where you can really see how much money you can 
make in an investment-right so this is the kind of the 
important part the historical chart the-performance chart 
these are historical stuff that lets you see how the 
stock-has performed but you can only invest in the future 
you can't invest in the past-and yes historical performance 
does not guarantee future performance but what it-does is 
let you see how well managed a company is and stay away 
from cyclicals-things like that like I'm confident in a 
company like elevance more than I am-confident in a company 
like Caterpillar or us steel for example or Ford right 
so-now we can take that information that we have and take 
it to the forecasting tool-and what the forecasting tool 
allows us to do is we show forecasts of the-company all 
sourced from analysts we show the median estimate for each 
one of-these years some companies are going to have more 
analysts some companies are-going to have less and then 
some companies might not have any analysts or-in any 
estimat that's just kind of the nature of the game with big 
data-unfortunately but what this does is we then plot what 
these estimates are going-to be and then just like on the 
historical chart we derive a fair value-formula based on 
that growth rate and I can plot over every single one of 
these-lines right and see what potential returns would be 
if it were to go to-these certain points right so elevance 
we are expecting roughly a-13.47% rate of return annualized 
rate of return okay so that's a total 355.82-82% return by 
2026 in conjunction with that I have-this thing called the 
analyst scorecard and what we do is we actually rate 
how-accurate the analysts have been in the past to give you 
more confidence in how-in those analysts going forwards and 
what we do for this is we we hold them-one year in advance 
and two years in advance so this estimate for 2014 
for-example they they a estimated $8.3 for 2014 fiscal year 
EPS that was-made a year prior back in 2013 we then give 
them a 10% margin of error so this-was a a 5% difference so 
we give it a hit right whereas this is a 23%-difference so 
they actually it was a beat and then the analysts have 
never-missed essentially so I can be really really really 
confident in these-analysts we did the same thing but at 
two years so this 2014 was actually made-in 2012 they were 
expecting 810 and it got 885 and we give the 2-year a 
20%-margin of error but that gives me a ton of confidence 
into what this company can-do and and what these analysts 
can do for this company we can then also look-at some 
previous estimates some current estimates these ones aren't 
changing a-lot so we're not seeing a big change but there's 
some companies where like UNFI-they can go through really 
big changes and this is due to a huge valuation at-this 
point we're looking at 298 right here so that that's why 
this graph is is-kind of blown out but as I can see I can 
change some of these and we're getting-different estimates 
down here that are the analysts were providing I use 
this-company as a as a big Stark difference I would have 
not def I would probably-avoid this company if I were you 
guys but going back to elevance I can run all-these 
calculations right I can then take the normal multiple hit 
this drop down-and I can take what historical normal 
multiples have been for this company I-can choose one of 
these low ones and make sure as a conservative 
estimate-okay I'm going to be returning maybe 8% per year 
okay so that's that's still a-great investment on a 
conservative side and so on so this this gives me 
more-detail more information this lets me take historical 
Norms now of how this-company has traded and lets me run 
investment analysis opportunities on-what I could be 
earning on this investment we also have a long-term-growth 
estimate this is a a single estimate provided by a data 
provider so-they're expecting 12% long-term growth once 
again you can do you can run your-mouse over all of these 
okay we also have a historical compound annual 
growth-notice that this defaults the fiveyear so does the 
normal multiple this-defaults to the fiveyear but you can 
change them to whatever year you want so-I can plot this 20 
% historical growth I mean this 13.5% historical growth 
rate-for the for the 20 years I can plot that that now 
changes the estimate on here-that will change what fair 
value multiple we are we are plotting based on-the growth 
rate and I can see that this company has is growing has 
grown solid-and I can use these historical Norms to see 
what potential investment returns-would be in the future 
okay so that's oh and I'm sorry there is the Custom 
Tool-this allows you to input whatever data you want 
basically I'm just going to-show a huge difference if I 
wanted to say if I expected they were going to-make $60 in 
earnings per share in 2025 I can plot that I can enter 
custom growth-rates I can if I want if I thought they're 
going to grow 30% per year right-I can plot that so the the 
custom chart just lets you put in custom data run-your own 
analysis basically if you if you've come up with certain 
assumptions-and numbers on your own the analy scorecard 
we've covered that This-research report this is a a beta 
not all companies going to have research reports-but we do 
have some available fund graphs is another very important 
feature-fund stands for fundamental underlying numbers this 
just lets you plot a bunch-of data for this company from 
the financial statements so just a big data-plotter lets 
you kind of run some more analysis on your own we have per 
share-we have in millions data so notice that this is sales 
revenue in millions if I-go to per share this is now going 
to show me sales per share okay like I can-come here I can 
see the the shares outstanding as well that's being 
blown-out by the sales so shares outstanding is dropping 
and that would affect how-sales per share is growing right 
so I would see a larger growth in sales back-here during 
that steeper drop of delution coming out basically 
where-they're they're taking shares out of the market and 
increasing shareholder value-through share BuyBacks so 
that's a really important thing to look back and-forth 
between the per share numbers and the en Millions number to 
see how much-Financial manipulation is happening right like 
a company can really boost up-their per share values by by 
buying back a ton of shares that would kind of 
show-manipulation in some numbers versus if their actual 
inm million sales have-flatlined we also have ratios so in 
here you can look at liquidity ratios so-current ratio 
quick ratio we've got some profitability ratios and then 
we've got-a ton of valuation ratios to also plot on here 
some of these companies-healthcare companies don't have 
ebit and eida so that's what we're seeing there-but now I'm 
plotting PE ratios right here I have a bunch of functions 
around-here you guys can feel fre free to play around with 
these they're pretty-straightforward logarithmic birth 
versus arithmetic lines versus bars things like-that just 
to make it an easier viewing experience for for you guys we 
then also-show financial statements for these companies and 
the financial statements-that we offer are pretty powerful 
the functions that they have so it's just a-a basic 
financial statement there's nothing fancy here right but I 
can then-plot this by clicking these charts here and I get 
compound annual growth numbers-and total growth numbers 
here so huge growth and sales in this company I can-then 
shorten this and this growth rate changes okay so this is 
reactive showing-you that data I can show it yearly I can 
show it in quarters so now I'm looking-at quarterly data I 
can also look at F so what f is is notice that we show 
the-fiscal years as well as the quarters themselves in 
between this doesn't have-a plottable value just because it 
wouldn't make any sense I can also click-up here and go 
directly to the 10 Q if I wanted to I can go to the 10K if 
I-wanted to so that's all super simple looks like the sec's 
loading time's-taken a little bit don't know what's going 
on on their end but yeah so I can-go to their financials 
really fast from there let's see is that loaded yet nope-I 
can look at period over period growth I can look at 
Absolute growth I can look-at as a percent of Revenue so 
this is basically looking at it like margins and-that sense 
I can look at the growth period over period growth here I 
can-reorder it and then I can do some adjustments if I need 
to for splits-fully adjusted and whatnot balance sheet same 
thing per period over period growth-this one is a as a 
percent of assets or as a percent of liabilities so all 
these-numbers are this cash only is the cash divided by the 
total assets whereas-liabilities is this is divided by the 
total liabilities and stockholders-Equity so it just gives 
you a better representation of the percent values on-these 
financial statements and then finally we have a-cash flow 
statement this only has absolute in Period over period 
growth-but let's you look at cash flow statements really 
easily and yeah same-functions over here we have a few 
other tools in the system we have portfolios-as well as 
screening tools so let's take a look at portfolios first 
you can-create tons of portfolios and we have a bunch of 
features that actually function-with that company app so 
that we were just in what we call the company app-we're now 
in the portfolio app so I can go in here I can actually 
plot buys and-sells in here so notice that I have Holdings 
data I I can plot transactions-of this and then we we offer 
as a as a basic portfolio that's what this one is-it's 
actually a or a simple portfolio is what it's called we 
have five Advanced-portfolios allowed for our premium users 
but basic allows me to still plot-transactions and then if 
I were to click on one of these notice that this has 
now-added this thing up here where it tells me the 
portfolio and then the tickers-right and then now I've 
plotted all of my buys and sells on here buys being-green 
sells being red with an average cost and then now I'm going 
to use the-arrow keys on my keyboard and I'm using the 
right arrow and I can quickly go-through this portfolio and 
I'm plotting all the buys and all the sells of 
this-portfolio right here so that's an awesome feature I 
can click in here and-change this I can plot we've got some 
premium portfolios we actually have-screens that you can 
also plot which I'll get into here in a minute it but-going 
back to the portfolios if I take a take a look at a 
advanced portfolio I-get quite a bit more data right so I'm 
getting the top gainers the top losers-the top traded I'm 
also getting some information right here so net 
investment-the xir on the equity the total Equity return of 
this portfolio the amount of-income I've actually earned on 
this portfolio and the current yield and this-is giving me 
a a date range for all of this data I can also toggle 
between-showing open positions in all of the positions I've 
ever had in a portfolio I-personally just do the open 
positions in my portfolio because obviously those are-the 
stocks that I'm following but if you want accurate track 
more accurate-tracking data then you should put in all of 
your buys and sells of your portfolio-not just your open 
positions but this gives me a quick look summary look at 
my-like day change of my portfolio so I can see Foot Locker 
and and and AMG and-these stocks right here they've all had 
good good gains over the last as of the-last close whereas 
Southwest Delta UNFI these companies right here we've 
seen-some losses and then we've got volume over here we 
then also have an event-feed so you can see cck this was 
the latest 10q that was released that was-actually released 
yesterday and then we have a port folio growth chart so 
this-is showing the net investment versus the value of the 
portfolio and this this is-actually edit or auditable so if 
I click on net investment I can see the deposits-and 
withdrawals of this portfolio equals the net investment and 
then as of right-now we assume that each buy is a deposit 
while each sell in dividend is a-withdrawal so it's showing 
you I this this portfolio had $779,000 worth of-buys based 
off of the sells and the income that was made off of it 
it's got-$113,000 in withdrawals and then now my gain is 
basically from the 65,000 to the-81,000 that exists right 
here if I scroll down here I can see some asset-allocation 
and sector diversification so I've got it broken down 
between midcap-large cap small cap and other and then same 
thing with sectors so this is-showing it as sectors so just 
giving me a a bunch of diversification information-on this 
and then we do we are working on a cache feature and 
actually are working-on a broker connected feature which is 
in beta we've actually released it to a-small amount of 
subscribers right now and we're fully testing that out 
but-what that does is it would allow you to connect your 
brokerage firms to directly-to fast graphs which would get 
a snapshot of and it would look like this-it would be an 
advanced portfolio but it would get any new trades that you 
have-by the end of the day it syncs up with that and then 
your positions everything-so it's just an it just automates 
it so you don't have to manually put in all of-your 
transactions getting back to this down here I have a really 
interesting-chart this lets me see the estimated growth 
rate and this is the growth rate-of the the smart metric 
that we have so going back to what we talked about at-the 
very beginning of this this is the estimated growth rate of 
the smart-metric not of the stock not of the investment 
itself but of the smart-metric and then the dividend yield 
okay so then what it lets me what it shows me-is the my 
kind of average of what my estimated like earnings growth 
rate of-my portfolio is going to be as well as the dividend 
yield and it's all based on-waiting and everything like 
that so this kind of gives me an interesting look-into how 
my portfolio is set up for future growth then we also have 
a-waiting chart down here this one's pretty straightforward 
under Holdings I-have a bunch of data here by the way 
you'll see all these symbols in these-tables when you see 
stocks and these are what we call snapshots so at any 
point-in time I can click this and a something a drawer 
pops out from the right side-and it just kind of gives me a 
quick snapshot of what that stock looks like-and at any 
point in time I can click these and it will draw it even 
from the-snapshot I can hit open section and go to any of 
these I want so if I wanted to-go to the forecasting 
section of cck I can do that straight from that snapshot-it 
opens it up in a new tab so you don't lose your old tab the 
Holdings tab I-mean this is just like a general thing that 
you'd see on your brokerage firm-shows you waiting market 
value ignore these two things over here this is just-some 
debugging stuff that we've had and then yeah just general 
stuff that you'd-be used to seeing from here I can look at 
transactions that's acting slow right-now but yeah here we 
go I can see all the transactions from right here 
really-fast and by the way if I were to plot one of these I 
can quickly see-transactions from within the company 
section as well so this lets me look at-the transactions in 
this specific portfolio I can add transactions-manually if 
I want and yeah the other thing you can do from here is add 
and-remove from portfolios so as you're going through a 
bunch of stocks you-might find a research candidate by 
clicking through some things maybe-you're clicking through 
one of our preset portfolios and you say wow that-stock 
looks really interesting I can quickly come here and hit 
add to-portfolio and maybe I have a watch list portfolio so 
we can go ahead and do that-we can create a quick watch 
list portfolio I'm just going to make it a-simple one I'm 
going to hit create manually I'm going to call it 
watch-watch list I'm going to keep it in USD and then 
there's no stocks in here I-could add Johnson and Johnson 
if I wanted to and LKQ maybe and oops Johnson-on Johnson on 
accident let me add the two of these so now I have those 
two in-there right now I'll get back to that adding to that 
watch list we have these-preset portfolios so I can go 
through I could go into this and see the S&P 500 I-could 
actually graph it from here by clicking that button and now 
I can-scroll through this and I could be like oh maybe 
apple or ABV or or one of these-stocks maybe I want to add 
this stock to my watch list so i' just go here and I-could 
add it to the watch list I could actually add it to these 
other ones too-if I want but hit save changes it's now in 
that watch list portfolio but yeah-back to this we have a 
bunch of preset portfolios for you guys to go through-and 
potentially find new investment candidates also one other 
thing that I-want to get to or show you guys is views so 
you can create unlimited views that-allow you to see 
certain data items right so this is an income and 
price-returns view for this portfolio so I'm looking at all 
these price returns and a-dividend yield I can edit this 
View and I could add G sector if I wanted to if I-were hit 
update it would updated across all the portfolios that have 
this view-or I could save this as a new view plus gex is 
what I could call it and I could-save this as a new view 
and now I've got these two and then now if I were to go-to 
another portfolio I could then add an existing View and 
refresh my page I-could add an existing View and there's 
that gix one so now I have that on two-portfolios also 
notice that I have this view manager where I can see all 
the-views that I have I can edit this view from here I can 
also manage what-portfolios this view is on all from here 
so it's just an easy spot to to handle-all of that all of 
this there's a lot of data to go through on here I 
definitely-recommend you guys going to the YouTube channel 
and taking a look at the-screening webinar that we did I 
think it was last week maybe two weeks ago but it-basically 
goes through a lot of this data the views and the screener 
have the-same data items in the same format so definitely 
recommend you guys going-through that also reach out to us 
at any point in time we have this thing down-here called 
intercom at any point in time you guys can drop us a 
message-we're here to help you have a question on something 
maybe you have a question-on how to build a screener in a 
specific way or what something means just drop us-a 
question we're here to help any point in time the last 
thing I want to show-you guys is the screening tool so it 
can be very daunting but I I promise it's-not too bad I 
definitely recommend you guys to go look at that 
screening-webinar we did a whole hour long on the screener 
and yeah I'm not going to go-into it detail from here but 
basically I mean I can search for certain stocks-right I 
can I can look for stocks in the consumer staple-with we're 
going to do long-term debt to Capital less than 50 I can do 
market cap-20 billion or more and let's do price return 
greater than 5% I don't know if-this going to give me 
anything no it didn't positive price returns let's look-at 
that there's 19 okay so there's a lot that you can do with 
this right screens-the whole database that we have super 
powerful screener and we're actually in-the process of 
redeveloping this screener to give you more 
powerful-features in the future like being able to-compare 
have it say I want the current PE ratio to be less than the 
5year-normal PE ratio some so some super powerful features 
coming out in the-future and then finally the last thing 
that we have is the preset screens so we-offer a bunch of 
preset screens for you guys to also find new stocks 
new-Investments and I can click on any of these here's the 
S&P 500 with growth-greater than1 % it's brought it down to 
34 stocks and this can change every day-as data changes it 
could FMC could could leave this and I can go through here 
and-look at it on a snapshot or if I click this it has now 
loaded that screen into-here and then now I can just 
quickly go through all of this right and I can find-boom 
Cummins maybe this is something I want on my watch list so 
then I go here-click add to watch list and there you go so 
that kind of sums up everything we've-got a couple 
questions on the on here that I want to answer because we 
have a-few minutes but other than that that kind of sums up 
everything for fast-graphs we definitely recommend you guys 
taking a look at the YouTube channel-like I said reaching 
out to us we have a learning center by the way if you 
click-this up here and click Learning Center there is a ton 
of information in here a-ton of Articles to read through 
and yeah go through this to learn certain things-about 
portfolios about the company section all of that but let's 
see oh-Keith that actually I think answers your question so 
yes we do have training-videos there's demo videos in here 
there's tutorials there's written-articles the whole 
YouTube channel is basically a demo video so like I said 
I-recommend checking that out going there Hector Martinez 
just asked about ETFs so-that is one of our biggest 
requested items we don't have ETFs yet but we're-going to 
work on getting those in and we we actually have have two 
ETFs we have-the spy and the iwv but those are the only two 
that we have right now but-we're going to work on on making 
this better but we visualize we will-visualize ETFs better 
than anybody no one will visualize it like a company-like 
this where we actually have a earnings line and everything 
for this to-actually represent valuation and whatnot but 
yeah ETFs are coming in the future-they are just not here 
yet cool well that's kind of it looks like that's it-for 
some questions Scott you asked about cost things like that 
and yeah I mean-I'm I'm not going to necessarily go through 
stocks right now we don't really-have the time for that but 
yeah I we may have some stuff on the YouTube 
channel-regarding regarding costs so make sure you check 
that out Jay we do not have an-iPhone app right now no we 
Prim we have fully focused on the web but we are-working on 
improving our mobile experience on the web and then we 
do-want to eventually get build a an actual iPhone and 
Android app in the future-cool well guys I really
