Hello Health Champions today I want to help you understand 
the biggest lie-about blood sugar and there's several 
components to this that when we believe-this and we don't 
understand how blood sugar works then we can get hurt so 
when-we're told that energy comes from blood sugar what 
does that mean is that all-energy is it some of the energy 
and this misunderstanding is so common that in-our culture 
we talk about it all the time that your blood sugar must be 
low-you're not feeling good your blood sugar must be low go 
ahead and eat something-to get your blood sugar back up now 
here's the problem when we buy into this-belief system that 
energy comes from blood sugar and you have to eat 
to-regulate your blood sugar then blood sugar which is 
supposed to be maintained-in a very narrow band for optimal 
function so now we go something and-blood sugar goes up but 
high blood sugar is not a good thing so the body needs 
to-regulate that and bring it back down and now we release 
insulin and our blood-sugar comes back down but now we feel 
bad we have a lack of energy we have-brain fog we don't 
feel good so now we're told eat something you must have-low 
blood sugar so we eat something blood sugar goes up now we 
feel good-insulin brings it down now we feel bad so we end 
up on this roller coaster if-we think that we need to eat 
to quickly top off that blood sugar to function-then we end 
up with this roller coaster and instead what the body is 
looking for-is stability so when we eat something if we-eat 
whole food with some fat and some protein not a bunch of 
sugar not a bunch-of processed foods your blood sugar is 
not supposed to go up very much at all-just because you eat 
something so it might rise a few points but it 
doesn't-really leave this narrow healthy band and then 
afterward it doesn't crash so-we don't get these mood 
swings and these ups and downs but the body instead 
can-maintain these blood sugar levels for level energy and 
level mood now blood-sugar is important but blood sugar is 
not the only source-of energy not even for the brain we're 
often told that the brain can only run-on glucose that's 
not true when we're really low on glucose when there's not 
a-lot available the body switches it has a backup system 
called ketones and as much-as 75% of energy for the brain 
can come from ketones but the key to understand-is that 
it's about stability and when we eat eat real food and we 
don't eat all-the time the body knows how to regulate this 
when we eat to top off blood sugar-when we think that a 
lack of food is the reason we feel the way we do now 
we-create these blood sugar roller coasters so if you do a 
little reading on what we-think is normal as a society the 
traditional view is that a normal-fasting blood sugar 
should be between 70 and 100 but then if you're 
impaired-meaning that you're pre-diabetic now that would be 
between-101 to 125 and if it goes above 125 it's called 
type 2 diabetes and so far that's-not all that crazy I sort 
of buy into this for the most part however then they-say 
that 30 minutes after a meal it's normal to have a blood 
sugar of 170 to-200 no that's not normal this is what they 
consider normal that's what we've-been trained to think by 
topping off our blood sugar and 30 minutes after a meal-if 
you're impaired if you're pre-diabetic then they say it's 
okay for-it to be 190 to 230 and if you're diabetic then 
220 to-300 would be expected but then it gets even crazier 
because they say that two-to three hours after a meal it's 
okay it's normal for it to still be 120 to-140 to still 
have elevated blood sugar several hours after a meal and if 
you're-impaired it could be 140 to 160 and if you're 
diabetic it could be over 200-several hours after a meal 
and it's good that they understand that a pre-diabetic-or 
diabetic that these numbers are too high several hours 
after but what's-crazy is that they think it's normal for 
it to be elevated that far after so-here's how it's 
supposed to work an optimal level first of all is lower 
it's-80 to 90 or if you're fasting a little bit longer or 
if you're in a low carb-diet then it can even be totally 
okay to be less than 80 but fasting should-really not be 
over 90 and then when you eat real food when you eat 
something-solid like putting a log on the fire that burns 
slowly for a long time then-you can still be in this range 
even after eating so 90 to 110 is optimal and-if you don't 
eat a bunch of processed food and sugar then it's not going 
to go-into these crazy numbers and then two to three hours 
you should be back at your-fasting level it should not be a 
major drama for the body a major challenge to-get it back 
back in you should eat something it rises a few points and 
then-it goes right back to balance and another way of 
looking at this is here-is the normal with the numbers and 
then if you're impaired it's a little bit-higher and it 
takes a little bit longer if you're diabetic then it's a 
little-bit higher to start with and it's much worse in 
bringing it down afterwards but-again the optimal is 
relatively to the to the other lines it's almost a 
flat-line so so if we look at the first 30 minutes after we 
eat then they're-suggesting that this would be normal 
whereas this is really how the body-should behave and I 
know we're told all the time about energy being calories 
to-get a certain energy you need so many calories but the 
food doesn't really-have calories it's only to the extent 
that we can convert it into ATP that is-the only form of 
energy that the body uses-so it's really pretty simple if 
you think about this as the a as the-adenosine and then we 
have different phosphates we have one two or 
three-phosphates and then we have like a little spring and 
we load that spring up-with the first phosphate and now 
it's called adenosine mono phosphate so-there's a tiny 
little bit of energy in that spring and then then we load 
up a-second spring with the second phosphate and now it's 
called a DP adenosine-diphosphate and then we load up a 
third one and of course now this third one is-called ATP 
for adenosine triphosphate so that's a high energy-state so 
the vast majority of energy production comes from Us 
loading up this-spring and then we pop off that third 
phosphate and then the body after you-use the energy the 
body goes right back into putting another phosphate on 
there-to make that high energy state so we go back and 
forth between ADP and ATP and-that's how the body makes 
energy and how the body uses energy so the body can use-two 
different Pathways to make this ATP and one is called 
oxidative-phosphorilation and the other one is 
called-glycolysis now oxidative simply means that it's 
aerobic it's with oxygen there-is enough oxygen present to 
fully complete this process and the other one-is called 
glycolysis and that's the one that doesn't have oxygen it's 
anerobic-and we don't have enough oxygen present to drive 
it now the key to understand is-that when we have oxygen 
present then it's much more efficient and in one-round of 
What's called the citric acid cycle we can make over 30 
atps whereas-when we don't have oxygen present when we just 
have to cleave a glucose-molecule break a glucose ring then 
we get two atps and the other thing to-understand is that 
the body can use either fat or glucose to oxidize the-fuel 
so it doesn't matter it's equally efficient when there is 
oxygen present-however when there is not then we can only 
use glucose we can only cleave that-glucose ring and get 
these two atps and fat doesn't work in that scenario 
but-this is what's supposed to happen normally that's 
what's supposed to-happen 99% of the time when we're at 
rest when-we're at moderate levels of activity then this 
cycle runs completely and when-we have an emergency when 
we're running up a hill when we're running from a-tiger now 
this is the emergency fuel kicks in but it's very very 
inefficient-and we have to use a lot of glucose for a very 
short period of time to generate-enough energy so for 
example 100 meter runner in just getting out of the 
blocks-when they're using maximum energy the highest power 
output a human can-generate we have about three seconds 
worth of ATP and then the body kicks in-and it starts 
making energy with oxygen through this oxidative 
phosphorilation-but in the 100 met Sprint we can't keep up 
so we're breaking down a lot of-glucose into lactic acid 
and that's where we get the muscle burn and we-start 
huffing and puffing and breathing really really hard but 
this is supposed-to be the exception and only run for a 
very short time and the most a human can-store of glycogen 
is about 1,400 calories whereas with fat it's 
almost-unlimited virtually everyone has at least a 100,000 
calories stored as fat-but a really obese person could have 
up to a million calories stored so another-way of looking 
at that is glycogen can last you about one day and fat can 
last-you for months and why does the body store it mostly 
as fat because it's so-much more effective to store it as 
fat so carbohydrates have four calories per-gram and fat 
has nine calories per gram but that's not even a fair 
comparison-because carbohydrates the glycogen also is like 
a sponge it binds a lot of water-it pulls water to it so in 
reality glycogen because every gram of glycogen-holds about 
three four grams of water then 75% of glycogen is really 
water so-we're only getting about one calorie per GR-when 
we store glycogen and with fat there is a tiny little bit 
of water in-fat tissue but we're really getting about eight 
calories per gram out of-that body tissue and the reason 
the body stores energy mostly as fat is that it's-the only 
practical the only reasonable way to do it so if you take 
the average-person of about 150 lounds and 25% body fat 
they're going to have about 100-35,000 calories stored as 
fat that's 17 kilogram or-375 pounds of fat and if you were 
to store that same amount of energy in the-body as glycogen 
then you would have to store-136 kilogram or about 300 
pound worth of glycogen by the time it pulls that water-to 
it so obviously ly you can't have 150 pounds of other 
tissue of muscles and-Bone and then store another 300 
pounds of energy it just doesn't work now-here's what we 
need to understand about this it's that fat is 8 times 
more-effective as a storage form for energy and therefore 
the innate balance in the-body is that more than 99% of our 
energy stores are in the form of fat but it-doesn't mean 
that you have to eat only fat because excess carbs are also 
stored-as fat and excess fat is also stored as fat but 
what's important is to-understand that this graph I grew 
with the blood sugar swings that blood sugar-swings make us 
store excess carbs but then we get hungry again whereas 
when we-eat fat and protein and fiber then we get full for 
a longer time and we are-much less likely to overeat so 
excess carbs is no problem it's very very easy-to eat 
excess carbs excess fat is not very easy to do and if fat 
is the form-that we store energy then that is also our 
preferred fuel it would be insane-for the body to store 99% 
of its energy as fat and then for the body to 
prefer-carbohydrate it's just doesn't work that way that's 
totally backwards and yes-blood sugar is very important but 
it's not going to be our main source of-energy so stable 
blood sugar is what we're looking for stable blood 
glucose-means stable energy unstable blood sugar that we 
get from topping off through the-food that is very unstable 
energy and not only energy but with that we also-get 
unstable mood and when we do this frequently and over and 
over like we've-done as a lifestyle in the modern world we 
also get on the track for insulin-resistance type 2 
diabetes cardiovascular disease and stroke and-also 
lowgrade chronic inflammation that contributes to all this 
as well as-dementia so don't buy into the lie that blood 
sugar is so important that it's-our only source our primary 
source of fuel and therefore we need to eat-frequent meals 
to maintain it and that leads us to eating high carbs 
starches-and sugar because if we get these blood sugar 
swings and we get on the low end-of that roller coaster 
then we're going to be craving these high carb 
starchy-sugary foods to bring that blood sugar up as fast 
as possible and now of course-we get blood sugar swings we 
get energy swings we get carb dependence because-with this 
pattern you train your body to have highs and lows and 
every time that-it's low then you depend on these carbs to 
bring it back up and once you're in-that situation now you 
perpetuate the need for more frequent meals and for-more 
High starchy sugary Foods so does that mean that car cars 
are evil well-there are many different types of carbs 
excess sugar excess processed carbs and-starchy carbs are 
not so great but then there's others in the form 
of-non-starchy vegetables like broccoli cauliflower 
asparagus Etc then there are-leafy greens which is exactly 
what they sound like and then there are carbs-called fiber 
that we can't digest but that can be important for other 
reasons-so if we're talking about metabolically if we're 
talking about a person's-metabolic Health about its 
carbohydrate tolerance the body-machine's ability to 
process through carbohydrates then the top three the-sugar 
processed carbs and starchy carbs are indeed evil with 
sugar being by far-the worst and starchy carbs not being so 
so bad for some people but also not-necessary and not 
something you should eat massive amounts of but the 
bottom-three are pretty much okay for anybody from a 
metabolic standpoint that you-could have almost as much 
non-starchy veggies as you like you could have as-much 
leafy greens as you like and you should eat a variety of 
food that gives-you a large variety of fiber but that's 
metabolically speaking now instead if we-talk about 
tolerance how well people do with these Foods that's a 
completely-different story and we have to put put a big 
question mark there because there's-thousands of different 
scenarios on why people would do well with these so 
for-example the top ones here some people might actually 
tolerate them pretty well-meaning they don't feel horrible 
because these are broken down very quickly and-absorbed 
early in the digestive tract whereas the ones on the bottom 
here-they have a much slower processing they have a lot of 
fiber that we can't digest-so very few of these in the 
bottom three are going to be absorbed quickly and get-into 
your bloodstream so most of these will stay in your gut and 
start feeding-the gut bacteria so depending on the type of 
bacteria you have you could do-horribly and get gassy and 
get toxic and not feel very well at all so we have 
to-understand that there's not a one siiz fits all so carbs 
are not evil per se-but the question then is do we actually 
need carbs so first of all there is no-such thing as an 
essential carbohydrate there's essential fatty acids 
there's-essential amino acids but carbs no next thing the 
brain does need a little bit-of glucose it can rely on 
ketones as we said but it does need glucose so if-you're 
fasting if there is no food available which has been the 
case for a-lot of human history then we can live off body 
fat and in that body fat there-is still about 5% glucose 
indirectly so body fat like we said is in the form 
of-triglycerides meaning Three fatty acids backed up to a 
glycerol backbone and-that glycerol can be turned into 
glucose so the short answer is that no we don't-need 
carbohydrates however your gut bacteria-do so then the 
question is do you actually need all that gut bacteria 
or-could you just stay carnivore for the rest of your life 
or do you have these-gut bacteria so you could eat and 
process the plant foods and the plant-Foods then feed this 
got bacteria and the bacteria have additional 
properties-additional benefits and this is what we don't 
know yet I'm going to be leaning-toward the camp that says 
we do need a v wide variety and we do need to eat a-wide 
variety of plant foods and the reason I would say that is 
that humans-probably in our history over hundreds of 
thousands of years probably have eaten a-wide variety of 
foods including both meat and a wide variety of fiber so 
I-would say probably for optimal long-term health so we 
also need to understand the-difference between most and all 
because once we do research and something comes-back and 
they say that this protocol was overwhelmingly significant 
that this-protocol helped eight out of 10 people get better 
better well that still means-that two out of 10 people did 
not get better they have some other type of-problem and on 
this channel I talk a lot about metabolic Health about 
insulin-resistance about processed foods and sugar because 
that is the problem for-about eight out of 10 people but it 
also means that it's not the problem for two-out of 10 
people so I also try to put in other things to help help 
you say the-bigger picture factors like stress and various 
deficiencies or toxicities if-you're deficient in nutrients 
or if you're toxic with heavy metals or-chemicals or 
pesticides if you have allergies if you-have chronic 
infections or immune issues if you have autoimmune diseases 
and also-there's something called endotoxicity that you 
could basically be-poisoning yourself from the inside by 
having disbiosis by having an imbalance-in your bacteria so 
certain bacteria when they overgrow they produce 
for-example something called lipopolysaccharides or LPS 
which is-extremely toxic to you but if you have an 
overgrowth and you keep feeding them-then you're going to 
be poisoning yourself from the inside all the time-and the 
reason I said on the previous slide that I believe that a 
healthy-varied strong microbiome probably is better for 
Optimal Health is that we-start seeing so much of these 
different problems and most of those are probably-gut 
related and because there are so many variables because we 
live in a very-complex very polluted world with lots of 
junk food and additives and antibiotics-and imbalances we 
need to measure if we truly want to know and there's 
several-different things we want to measure we want to 
measure our metabolic Spectrum-where are we on the spectrum 
of insulin resistance and metabolic health so-people on the 
green side meaning very insulin sensitive can eat 
completely-different foods than the people who are on the 
insulin resistant side of the-spectrum and the main things 
we want to measure here are directly involved with-this is 
glucose triglycerides A1C and insulin and the first two are 
going to-be on virtually every blood test they ever run A1C 
is kind of Hit or Miss and-Insulin you will never find on a 
standard blood test performed by a-medical doctor and that 
might be or that is the most important marker to help 
us-understand our metabolic Health we need to understand 
cholesterol for many many-different reasons it is an 
important factor it is an indirect marker for-inflammation 
and cardiovascular disease but we need to measure the 
things that-matter we need to measure your LDL particle 
count your LDL particle size-and the number of small LDL 
particles another good idea is to measure-something about 
your autoimmunity because that be becoming so 
prevalent-these days you could measure your thyroid 
peroxidase your t po antibodies-and your thyroglobulin 
antibodies because they're going to be by far the-most 
common there are also tests for brain health for cognitive 
function you-can measure your Omega 6 to omega3 ratios as 
well as your EPA and your DHA-status and that's going to 
tell you a lot about your brain health and your-cognitive 
function and last but not least more and more people 
probably want-to look into their gut health as well and 
here we measure a microbiome D-sequencing so a complete 
sequencing of all the bacteria there so not every-person on 
the planet is going to need all of these different tests if 
you just-start eating real food and you get fantastically 
better then great but if-you tried a lot of things and 
you're not getting better then chances are that-your answer 
is going to be in one of these categories or maybe several 
of-them so I'll put some resources down below if you want
