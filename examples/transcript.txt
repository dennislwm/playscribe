glory to Jesus Christ I'm mother Natalya a Byzantine 
Catholic nun from Christ the-bridegroom Monastery and this 
is Pines with-aquinus last week in our church we had the 
Feast of the procession of the Cross-we have this Feast 
every year on August 1st and I was praying on that day 
with-the gospel uh from St John uh the 19th Chapter leading 
up to-the crucifixion when the chief priests and-the 
officers saw him they cried out crucify him crucify him 
pilate said to-them take him yourselves and crucify him for 
I find no crime in him the Jews-answered him we have a law 
and by that law he ought to die because he has made-himself 
the Son of God when pilate heard these words he was-even 
more afraid he entered the pretorium again-and said to 
Jesus where are you from but Jesus gave no answer pilate 
therefore-said to him you will not speak to me do you not 
know-that I have power to release you and power to crucify 
you Jesus answered him-you would have no power over me 
unless it had been given to you from above-therefore he who 
delivered me to you has the greater-sin upon this pilate 
sought to release him but the Jews cried out if you-release 
this man you are not Caesar's friend everyone who makes 
himself a king-sets himself against Caesar as I was praying 
with this-passage I was struck by just the role that fear 
plays in-Pilot's decisions here because there's this-fear 
in him I think a righteous fear as he realizes who Jesus 
could be and and-what's at stake here but then it's 
outweighed by this-greater fear that comes when the Jews 
basically threaten him and-say will let people know that 
you're not Caesar's friend if you don't if you-don't 
crucify this man so pilate is torn-between a fear of God 
and a fear of man and so I was reflecting on how we-see 
this theme throughout all of the gospels I think most 
especially we see-it with the Pharisees as how many times 
in the gospels you know we read that-they answered a 
question a certain way out of fear of the-people and you 
know the only one obviously who doesn't do this is 
Jesus-Jesus is never acting out of fear but we see this 
with the Pharisees we see this-with st fotina the woman at 
the well who goes to the well at the hottest hour of-the 
day out of fear of encountering other-people we see this in 
the disciples who flee who flee from suffering afraid 
of-suffering but then we also have we have coming up this 
week another-Feast on August 6th in in our calendar we 
celebrate the Feast of the-Transfiguration and in Matthew's 
account of the Transfiguration it says that-after the 
disciples uh they see the glory of the Lord and they they 
fall to-the ground in awe or some translations will-say in 
fear and in Matthew's account it says-Jesus came and 
touched them saying rise and have no-fear we see something 
similar in the sixth chapter of John when Jesus is-walking 
on the sea and it says they were frightened but he said 
to-them it is I do not be afraid it is-I the Greek the 
Greek words here for it is I I apologize for my 
terrible-pronunciation but the Greek words are egoi this is 
the these are the same-Greek words that would be used for 
the I am who-am and these are the same words that are used 
in the 18th chapter of St-John when Jesus is arrested in 
Gethsemane-and and when he says when they say that they're 
looking for Jesus of Nazareth he-uses these same words AO 
me I am it is I but in in the 18th chapter of John 
in-response to these words the soldiers draw back and fall 
to the-ground so Jesus uses these words to comfort his 
disciples it is I do not be-afraid and then he uses these 
same words and it instills fear in the guards in-the 
soldiers and I-guess that brings up the point that I desire 
to make the the question that I-think we need to be asking 
ourselves is what are you afraid of-do you have a righteous 
fear of God and I'm going to talk about that in a-second or 
are you afraid of people because we shouldn't-fear an 
encounter with the Lord because in an encounter with him 
he-says it is I do not be afraid I think the only thing 
that we-should fear is loss of relationship with-him you 
know we we should have a good fear of-hell not because of 
the punishments of hell but a fear of ever not being 
with-him of not being with the one that we love you know as 
St John says in his-first epist Soul perfect love casts 
out-fear so as I was praying with all of this I was I 
was-examining the places in my life that I act out of-fear 
the ways in which I'm codependent in my-relationships that 
I'm afraid that acting certain ways doing-certain things 
saying certain things-will cause me to not be liked that 
I'll be-misunderstood you know a fear that I'm going to 
lose a friend the fear-that people won't think I'm holy the 
fear that you won't like this-Pines with aquinus episode 
and I think it's really helpful-to look at those places of 
fear and to ask this question what are you afraid-of which 
of pilot fears are we falling into so I want to go back to 
that that-verse from the first letter of St John that 
perfect love casts out-fear it's a verse that I often pray 
with because I'm really torn there um-because God is love 
and it's it's his perfect-love that casts out fear as our 
love becomes perfected we-become less afraid because we 
only love because he-first loves us but we also read that 
the fear of God-is the beginning of wisdom and so I'm 
always kind of like how do I reconcile-these two things we 
say that perfect love casts out fear-but then we're also 
like but a little bit of fear is good and and so so how 
do-I reconcile these two things and I just read-um this 
fantastic this fantastic excerpt from my-man St Maximus the 
Confessor and I'd like to share it with-you because to a 
degree he answers this question question for-me so this is 
from something that he wrote to it just-says a devout 
Christian so I don't know the man who's receiving 
this-letter he says I have greatly admired your self 
abasement and have tempered my-fear of you with affection 
and from both have formed a-love based on respect and 
Goodwill I have combined the two in case-fear stripped of 
affection should turn into-hatred or affection deprived of 
fear should turn into over-familiarity in this way love 
becomes an inward law of tenderness assimilating-everything 
naturally akin to it mastering hatred through Goodwill 
and-over familiarity through respect David the psalmist 
says fear of-the Lord is pure and endures forever because 
he knows that of all things-fear is best able to preserve 
Divine love such a fear he-realizes is very different from 
the fear of being punished for-crimes this second type of 
fear is indeed ousted and destroyed by love as-St John the 
Evangelist makes clear when he says love casts out-fear but 
the fear David is talking about is a natural expression of 
the law of-true tenderness and it is through this fear-that 
the Saints always keep intact the rule and practice of love 
both for God-and for each other so I think ultimately the 
question-that we need to ask is is our fear helping or 
hindering our love our love-for God and our love for others 
is fear pushing us towards God to-rely on him to trust more 
on him trust more in-him or is fear pushing us to 
self-reliance is it pushing us to to-close off parts of our 
heart to the-Lord or to others who he's asking us to open 
our hearts-to and I think the we then have the question-of 
what do we do if it's that latter fear what do we do if 
it's the fear that-we shouldn't be acting out of the fear 
that's debilitating the fear that's-keeping us from Love 
and I know this sounds like an-oversimplification but I 
learned about on my retreat last year I think it was-last 
year I learned about this concept that's practiced in 
alcoholic synonymous-and it's this as if mentality and 
what's talked about is if you're-striving for a certain 
virtue and you know you don't have that-virtue if you're 
striving to overcome a defect something in you some defect 
you-wish you didn't have then act as if you didn't have 
this-defect and again it sounds very simple but I can't 
tell you what a difference-this has made in my life as I've 
been remembering this in in praying to-prepare for this 
episode uh I've been putting it into practice the past 
couple-of days cuz I had totally forgotten about it and it 
just makes a tremendous-and immediate difference you know 
an example of this was I I was frustrated-with someone 
something that someone had done and I just was judging them 
just-straight up very judgmental and so I thought to myself 
how would I act-towards this person if I were not 
judgmental-and then I chose to act in that way as opposed 
to the ways that I was-just pushed to act by my judgment 
and yeah so I think similarly ask-yourself what am I afraid 
of and if the fear is not helpful if the-fear is not of the 
Lord um that righteous fear that good fear if it's-not not 
pushing you towards him if it's drawing you away from him 
then ask-yourself how would I act if I were not afraid and 
then act in that-way because that is to act with courage 
you know courage is not the same as-fearlessness courage is 
not an absence of fear courage is choosing to act in-spite 
of fear and um yeah I just pray that that-you and I can can 
be courageous in the name of the father and of the son and 
of-the holy spirit amen heavenly father thank you for 
the-gift of this day for the gift of technology-which 
allows us when we use it well to draw closer to-you and 
closer to one another I ask that you grant us an-awareness 
of any movements of fear in our-hearts help us to know 
where that fear is coming-from and how you wish us to act 
help us to keep our gaze fixed on-the face of your son our 
bridegroom that we may always move-towards him that the 
only fear that we-experience be a fear of not having-him of 
not being in Union with you and your spirit and your-son 
grant us courage I ask all of this and thank you-for these 
things through the intercession of St Thomas-aquinus St 
Bartholomew St Maximus the-Confessor the most holy 
theotokos and all the saints through the prayers of-our 
holy fathers O Lord Jesus Christ Our God have mercy on us 
amen
