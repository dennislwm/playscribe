moving from exercise to your second favorite-nutrition um I 
think it'd be helpful to start kind of what's your 
framework for-how you think about nutrition because you 
don't necessarily think about-nutrition as some people talk 
about it which is this diet's best or this diet's-best you 
kind of look at it a little bit of a different way and so 
do you want to-walk people through your framework in how 
you assess nutrition and where-someone is at in their 
nutritional State yeah I mean I would say that nut ntion-is 
is a very complicated thing to study I would say it's the 
messiest of all the-pillars to study probably even messier 
than emotional health although maybe-that's debatable but 
um you know the reasons for it are obvious and not 
worth-restating but it's for that reason that there are 
very few things that can be-stated in this field with a 
high high degree of certainty so unfortunately 
the-challenge in nutrition is you have a lot of people that 
speak with such insane-conviction and they talk about 
something as though it is absolutely correct even-though if 
you were putting an error bar on their statement it would 
dwarf-anything they're saying and truthfully I have been 
guilty of this right I think-12 years ago I was talking 
about nutrition with a level of certainty that-I don't 
think was warranted and so As the adage goes the further 
you get from-the shore the deeper the water and I think in 
my older age I'm actually quite-far out from the shore and 
I realize the water is awfully deep out here and 
there-aren't a lot of things that can be stated at a high 
enough degree of-certainty that you should act on them with 
you know almost Blind Faith so here-are the two that I can 
tell you with a very very high degree of-certainty the 
first is that the single most important input from 
nutrition to a-person's overall health is energy balance 
stated another way the energy-input of food is the first 
order determinant of-Health maybe stated another way the 
total calories you consume-would be the most important 
thing not the only thing I do not want to suggest-that a 
th000 calories of tic tacs is the same as 1,000 calories of 
broccoli it is-not but I'm also talking about this through 
the lens of Common Sense and the-truth of it is if you 
subside on a diet of tic tacs you're going to eat a 
lot-more than a th000 calories of them because they're not 
satiating and-they're junk and they're Hollow so I want to 
be very clear that the primary-input is total energy but it 
is also impacted by many other things including-diet 
quality processing and macronutrient-distribution the 
second thing that is abundantly clear is that protein is 
the-macronutrient we should be least flexible on state it 
another way-we can be quite flexible on how much 
carbohydrate and fat we consume to fill-our energy needs 
but because protein is not consumed for the purpose of 
ATP-generation which is the principal reason we consume 
carbohydrates and fats-although fats are also essential for 
some structural purposes we cannot be-too flexible or 
compromising in our protein requirements in other words-if 
you really wanted to just come up with a single number to 
give people I-would say on average about 1.6 grams of 
protein per kilogram of-body weight should be consumed by 
everybody now again I hate saying that-because there's 
truly nothing that you can say across the board there 
are-clearly people who based on what they're eating will 
need more protein and there-are probably people who can get 
away with a little bit less you know uh if-you took a 
perfectly highquality PDC 1.0 protein in a person who's not 
over the-moon active they could probably get away with 1.2 
grams or even one gram but boy-anything below that and 
you're starting to really miss out and by the way as 
you-age that those requirements go up due to anabolic 
resistance so again we can talk-all day about every diet 
under the sun and every religion and every faction of-every 
religion around every dietary tribe but the truth-of it is 
it's really hard to find a scientist an actual nutrition 
scientist-I'm not talking about an influencer I'm not 
talking about a health block I'm-talking about actual 
people who work in Labs doing nutrition who will Who 
will-kind of disagree with that statement there are some 
but they are in the huge-minority and interestingly they 
tend to avoid using human data uh when they talk-about 
those things but um when you when you limit yourself to the 
species of-Interest which is humans not rodents and you 
talk about experimental data uh-coupled with you know other 
insights um those two things seem to matter the most-how 
many calories are you getting not too much not too little 
are you getting-enough protein um obviously there are other 
terms we certainly want to make-sure you're getting enough 
micro nutrients as well and that you're-avoiding toxins 
that tends to be less of an issue today than it was 100 
years ago-um but of course that's also really interesting 
um but a lot of the other-stuff Nick is details right so uh 
when I'm looking at a-patient given how important those 
things are to me it makes sense to be-evaluating those 
things at the outset so when we do a dexa scan on some body 
on-day one and we can see how much subcutaneous fat they 
have how much-visceral fat they have how much muscle mass 
they have and we can do a lot of-advanced blood work and 
see how metabolically healthy they are how well-they 
dispose of glucose all these other things I can very 
quickly answer three-questions literally on First Contact 
are you overnourished or-undernourished and that really 
comes down to energy balance how much fat do-you have on 
your body and how well is it distributed throughout your 
body where-is it distributed second question are you 
adequately muscled or are you under-muscled third question 
are you metabolically healthy or not and when-you can 
answer those three questions which you can in a very short 
period of-time with a relatively small amount of data that 
tells you does this person-need to eat more less or the 
same total energy-the same amount of protein or less and 
how important and what type of exercise-should they be 
doing to augment our findings now because we're talking 
about-nutrition I'll close this out by saying most people 
when they do this come out-slightly in the overnourished 
category that's just another way of saying most-people are 
overweight or obese right I think the numbers are probably 
70% of-the population are over nourished or 
significantly-overnourished therefore most people when you 
go through that whole treatment-algorithm are going to be 
in the I need to eat less Camp if you are in the I-need to 
eat less Camp you now have three ways to do that three 
strategies if you-will the first is directly reducing 
caloric intake so that says agnostic to-what or when I eat 
I will simply eat less this is the most direct way to do-it 
um it has lots of pluses and minuses which I've discussed 
in so much detail-in other podcast that we'll link to the 
second method is I will identify-something or some set of 
things in the diet that I will remove from the diet I-will 
restrict them this is called dietary restriction and the 
more-restrictive the elements of your diet the more 
effective this this technique-is so if you only choose to 
restrict lettuce this will have no effect if you-restrict 
everything but potatoes meaning if the only thing you allow 
yourself to-eat is potatoes this will have an enormous 
effect so again the more you-restrict the better that works 
and then the third strategy is time restriction-where you 
limit the window in which you eat and the narrower and 
narrower that-window the greater the likelihood that you 
will overall induce a caloric-deficit so you know there's a 
lot more I can say about nutrition we could get-into the 
nuances of which type of fats are better saturated 
fats-monounsaturated polyunsaturated fats is a 
Mediterranean diet more efficacious-than a low carb diet or 
um uh a lowfat diet and again all of those things uh-again 
I've written about I've spoken about but but I think from 
from the-standpoint of like what are the most important 
things I think that I think-you've got it have you 
remembered what you ate for lunch yet that's I think 
the-only thing from the nutrition conversation that's 
missing I scarfed-down some leftover spaghetti squash that 
we made yesterday-and what else did I have oh I had I had a 
uh like a container of uh uh-blackberries and I had some 
venison [Music]-w
