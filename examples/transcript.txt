[Music] 3-2 one lift-off we have left the sandbox I want 
you to imagine yourself-being a part of a Sixers crew 
aboard the International Space-Station your job is to 
conduct scientific experiments and maintain the-station 
many missions like yours have flown before 64 to be-exact 
communication with ground control family friends is 
instantaneous you can-check Facebook it's okay there is 
some medical help on board-however if you do need to be 
brought back down to earth for life-saving-surgery it is 
possible now imagine you're part of a-team building a lunar 
base I kid you not in 10 years time we're going-there the 
idea is you're part of a very large team of people building 
field-hospitals research facilities launch platforms living 
quarters there is about-a 3 second delay with Earth you 
could be there on a short-duration Mission you could be 
there in a long duration Mission there are many-people from 
many different countries now I told you there are field 
hospitals so-you could get help however if you do need some 
additional assistance from-Earth or extra gravity 
theoretically it's possible to bring you down Why Stop-on 
the moon let's go to Mars imagine you're part of a 9-year 
mission on the-way to Mars you're part of a team that 
you've trained in for many many years-your well-oiled 
intelligent machine now delay with Earth is about 6-to 44 
minutes depending how far away you are no help is coming 
the resources you-have brought the people on board are 
your-help you are the first humans not to see Earth my work 
looks at teams at the-International Space Station we aim to 
answer questions such as is space flight-stressful how do 
we cope with space flight what kind of value systems do 
we-have what motivates people to go into these-environments 
do we what do we do our free time when we're there there's 
lots-of free time in the nine years on the way to-Mars um 
do we form a culture away from home now I answer tried to 
answer some-of these questions on International Space 
Station so that we can help those-teams going to moon and 
Mars as part of my PhD dissertation along-with Dr Peter sui 
and Phyllis Johnson at UBC I looked at a variety of 
archival-documents from austronaut such as books Diaries 
journals blogs and some-Cosmonaut questionnaire data and we 
try to answer some of these questions now-before I tell you 
what we found I want you to stop and think could you 
leave-your sandbox could you challenge yourself to-overcome 
your obstacles and be okay could you leave your sandbox 
and-come out better could you grow could something positive 
happen to-you the first construct we looked at is something 
called coping it's the thing-you and I do when we're 
stressed in my field we Define this as a response to 
an-environmental or psychological challenge serving to 
reduce prevent and control-negative affect let me give you 
an example you're on your way here to this-event you get a 
flat tire and Highway one you're going to be late now 
one-thing you could do is just deny the fact that you flat 
and keep driving and hope-you make it who knows another 
thing you could do-is you can posibly reframe the situation 
and say you know what I've always wanted-to have a flat 
tire let's see let's see if I could do-it these are called 
called emotional Focus coping strategies the idea here 
is-we modify the meaning of the stress to ourselves let's 
try that again we're-stuck on the highway there's a flat 
we're-late we could call a friend we know it's also coming 
to the and ask them to stop-and help asking for support 
what we could also do is while we're waiting for-that 
support to come we can actually read the owner's manual and 
do a-refresher course on how to change a tire when your 
friend comes you two can-change the tire be on the way and 
hopefully make it before 6-o' now these are called Problem 
Focus coping strategies the idea is we modify-the situation 
we modify the stressor in order to reduce the stress we 
are-experiencing research suggests we need a little bit of 
bucket a and a little bit-of bucket B in order to cope 
properly with stressors different contexts this-desire a 
variety of different coping strategies in order for us to 
properly-deal with the situation research also suggests 
that those who focus a little-bit more on those problem 
oriented strategies are more likely to experience-growth 
resilience and do better in future-challenges so what did 
we find when we ask retired cosmonauts how stressful 
was-your career on average they report very low levels-of 
stress compared to you and I the general population there's 
no-significant difference surprising-right when we look 
over a variety of samples of people who have went to 
space-we see that they use overwhelmingly seeking social 
support-and planful problem solving those problem focused 
strategies but we need a-little bit of those emotional ones 
as well they mention using humor positive-reap phrasal and 
accepting responsibility the stress is low and-they're able 
to deal with it they're up in space you-guys the next thing 
we looked at is something called values there are 
goals-that drive our desirable Behavior there's about 10 
Universal-values that we each have the vary in importance 
there are self-serving values-such as achievement yes I got 
to do this talk tonight you guys or 
there's-self-transcending values such as benevolence 
universalism spirituality-where you care more about those 
around you your relationships in the world so I-want to 
leave the world a better place for my kids I make sure we 
do Shoreline-cleanups and we learn how to reuse reduce 
and-recycle over many samples of people who have went to 
space we see that they-value achievement they want to keep 
succeeding and they value enjoyment they-have fun they're 
having fun and they want to do more however the 
longer-individuals stay in Space the more we see this rise 
in values of benevolence-um universalism and spirituality 
and we look at those little value markers that-make up each 
value we see that meaningful life Unity with 
nature-protecting the environment world of Peace are those 
value markers that are-significantly changing as their 
flight changes being in space longer changes-you for the 
better you care more about people on Earth you care more 
about-Earth you care about more more about 
those-relationships following that we wanted to see whether 
people do change we-looked at something called 
post-experience change it's based on a-scale measuring 
post-traumatic growth with modified scales with 
modified-items idea is when we go through major life events 
we-change we could change for the better we could change in 
a positive direction no-matter what that experience is when 
we looked at the retired Cosmonaut sample-what we found is 
slight changes in ideas such as they experience and are 
able to-have new opportunities because they've been 
in-space they also say that they learn how to believe in 
themselves and think that-they are capable of so much more 
than they thought they could do and they all-talk about the 
Earth that Blue Marble the Earth the vastness of space-they 
realize how meaningful their one life is and how they have 
to do as much-as they possibly can now you're thinking to 
yourself-Yelena we're not going to space space is too far 
too scary why are you telling us-about this I am definitely 
not going to space I talk too much I move too much-nobody 
wants to be stuck with me for any period of time maybe my 
husband but-nobody else now maybe we're lucky enough 
to-take up a job in the Canadian Arctic I conduct research 
on earth based-platforms such as the Arctic and Antarctic 
because these are called-analog environments they have 
similar characteristics to space not the same-but similar 
the outside environment is Harsh we have to properly suit 
up to go-out there we have to be well trained in order to 
succeed and we have to rely on-our team ourselves and our 
resources because help is sometimes days weeks or-even 
months away now was fortunate and enough to-connect data at 
Eureka weather station ellsmere Island that red dot 
that's-where they are that is far up north we based this 
study on a project called-ihom space that is led by Dr 
Phyllis Johnson at UBC and we are conducting-that project 
at the International Space Station in real time we wanted 
to do a-similar project on Earth to see how they compare 
now at Eureka people go up in-teams about six to eight 
they're up there for about two to four months-depending on 
the season and their job the reason they're there is to 
re-release these weather balloons every hour 20 24 hours a 
day that's the-building they keep the balloons in when you 
pulled out your phone today-to check out that weather app 
that's them that's where the data is coming-from that's why 
we know the weather now when I ask-them is it stressful 
being up in the aric do you know what they said no it's-not 
compared to you and I the general population they don't 
experience any-more stress of work than you and I do they 
mention using active coping-planning seeking instrumental 
social support um as their strategies they also-mention 
using coping and positive reframe R now does that remind 
you of-anybody else we talked about tonight it appears that 
two very different-challenging environments people use the 
same strategies and experience stress a-very similar way 
when we asked-them you know did you change this group had 
positive moderate to Great change-and something called 
relating to others now when I interviewed them they-told me 
oh my God I made the best friends up there those 
relationships are-so important I want to make sure 
those-relationships stay with me when I come back home and 
I wanted to also make sure-that my relationships at home 
with my family and friends were important to me-and I would 
nourished them they too experienced New Opportunities 
because-they took to work up at Eureka and they too 
standing in the vastness of the-Arctic realized they are 
little and their life is little and-short and look at this 
big blue planet we live on I got to do the best I can-with 
the life that I do have you don't want to go to the 
Arctic-either too cold I know I'd rather be on the beach 
not for me um I bet you though-you hiked one of the local 
mountains I do and I hate going uphill but I've done-it I 
am triple fortunate to be able to have-worked with BC 
search and rescue Association they compose about 78 
groups-across the province they're made of about 3,000 
highly trained skilled-unpaid professional volunteers now 
they don't live in the-extreme and unusual environment they 
just work in it but they too have to-suit up for the 
conditions they too have to be well trained to be able to 
go out-there and more so than anybody else deals with a 
different challenge that-risks their life every time they 
go out on a-call when we asked this group after one of the 
busiest search and rescue season-in British Colombia ever 
recorded how stressful was it on a scale from zero to-100 
they told us about 35 out of 100 don't go calling them 
though be-safe now day two men mentioned using active 
coping planning seeking emotional-support but they more 
than any other group mentioned using acceptance 
an-emotional strategy that doesn't modify the situation 
doesn't modify the-environment they just accept imagine you 
in a-call there's a skier and all of a sudden there's an 
avalanche you can't do-anything to change the environment 
it is as is you can be mad you can be sad you-can be angry 
that's okay like there's nothing you can't modify-that you 
can't change that you just have to wait accept and wait 
till you can go-and help people surprise surprise this 
group too-experiences new opportunities as participating in 
these-environments day two um realize that they are capable 
of more than they-thought they could and day two more so 
than any group-realize how finite our life is they have 
rescued people of these mountains they-realize that they 
have to do as much as they can with the time that they 
do-have now I challenged you I made you go to Mars then we 
went to the cold Arctic-we should have went to the beach 
but we went to the-Arctic and then we went into our local 
Wilderness three very different-challenging extreme 
environments these individuals stepped out of their 
sandbox-they challenged themselves and they were okay 
remember they learned how to cope-those stressors theyve 
perceived the stress to be low they grew they changed-for 
the better so I challenge you to challenge yourself to step 
out of your-sandbox whatever they that may be because I 
know you are hearty I know you-are resilient and I know you 
can do way more than you thought possible thank-[Applause]

goals-that drive our desirable Behavior there's about 10 
Universal-values that we each have the vary in importance 
there are self-serving values-such as achievement yes I got 
to do this talk tonight you guys or 
there's-self-transcending values such as benevolence 
universalism spirituality-where you care more about those 
around you your relationships in the world so I-want to 
leave the world a better place for my kids I make sure we 
do Shoreline-cleanups and we learn how to reuse reduce 
and-recycle over many samples of people who have went to 
space we see that they-value achievement they want to keep 
succeeding and they value enjoyment they-have fun they're 
having fun and they want to do more however the 
longer-individuals stay in Space the more we see this rise 
in values of benevolence-um universalism and spirituality 
and we look at those little value markers that-make up each 
value we see that meaningful life Unity with 
nature-protecting the environment world of Peace are those 
value markers that are-significantly changing as their 
flight changes being in space longer changes-you for the 
better you care more about people on Earth you care more 
about-Earth you care about more more about 
those-relationships following that we wanted to see whether 
people do change we-looked at something called 
post-experience change it's based on a-scale measuring 
post-traumatic growth with modified scales with 
modified-items idea is when we go through major life events 
we-change we could change for the better we could change in 
a positive direction no-matter what that experience is when 
we looked at the retired Cosmonaut sample-what we found is 
slight changes in ideas such as they experience and are 
able to-have new opportunities because they've been 
in-space they also say that they learn how to believe in 
themselves and think that-they are capable of so much more 
than they thought they could do and they all-talk about the 
Earth that Blue Marble the Earth the vastness of space-they 
realize how meaningful their one life is and how they have 
to do as much-as they possibly can now you're thinking to 
yourself-Yelena we're not going to space space is too far 
too scary why are you telling us-about this I am definitely 
not going to space I talk too much I move too much-nobody 
wants to be stuck with me for any period of time maybe my 
husband but-nobody else now maybe we're lucky enough 
to-take up a job in the Canadian Arctic I conduct research 
on earth based-platforms such as the Arctic and Antarctic 
because these are called-analog environments they have 
similar characteristics to space not the same-but similar 
the outside environment is Harsh we have to properly suit 
up to go-out there we have to be well trained in order to 
succeed and we have to rely on-our team ourselves and our 
resources because help is sometimes days weeks or-even 
months away now was fortunate and enough to-connect data at 
Eureka weather station ellsmere Island that red dot 
that's-where they are that is far up north we based this 
study on a project called-ihom space that is led by Dr 
Phyllis Johnson at UBC and we are conducting-that project 
at the International Space Station in real time we wanted 
to do a-similar project on Earth to see how they compare 
now at Eureka people go up in-teams about six to eight 
they're up there for about two to four months-depending on 
the season and their job the reason they're there is to 
re-release these weather balloons every hour 20 24 hours a 
day that's the-building they keep the balloons in when you 
pulled out your phone today-to check out that weather app 
that's them that's where the data is coming-from that's why 
we know the weather now when I ask-them is it stressful 
being up in the aric do you know what they said no it's-not 
compared to you and I the general population they don't 
experience any-more stress of work than you and I do they 
mention using active coping-planning seeking instrumental 
social support um as their strategies they also-mention 
using coping and positive reframe R now does that remind 
you of-anybody else we talked about tonight it appears that 
two very different-challenging environments people use the 
same strategies and experience stress a-very similar way 
when we asked-them you know did you change this group had 
positive moderate to Great change-and something called 
relating to others now when I interviewed them they-told me 
oh my God I made the best friends up there those 
relationships are-so important I want to make sure 
those-relationships stay with me when I come back home and 
I wanted to also make sure-that my relationships at home 
with my family and friends were important to me-and I would 
nourished them they too experienced New Opportunities 
because-they took to work up at Eureka and they too 
standing in the vastness of the-Arctic realized they are 
little and their life is little and-short and look at this 
big blue planet we live on I got to do the best I can-with 
the life that I do have you don't want to go to the 
Arctic-either too cold I know I'd rather be on the beach 
not for me um I bet you though-you hiked one of the local 
mountains I do and I hate going uphill but I've done-it I 
am triple fortunate to be able to have-worked with BC 
search and rescue Association they compose about 78 
groups-across the province they're made of about 3,000 
highly trained skilled-unpaid professional volunteers now 
they don't live in the-extreme and unusual environment they 
just work in it but they too have to-suit up for the 
conditions they too have to be well trained to be able to 
go out-there and more so than anybody else deals with a 
different challenge that-risks their life every time they 
go out on a-call when we asked this group after one of the 
busiest search and rescue season-in British Colombia ever 
recorded how stressful was it on a scale from zero to-100 
they told us about 35 out of 100 don't go calling them 
though be-safe now day two men mentioned using active 
coping planning seeking emotional-support but they more 
than any other group mentioned using acceptance 
an-emotional strategy that doesn't modify the situation 
doesn't modify the-environment they just accept imagine you 
in a-call there's a skier and all of a sudden there's an 
avalanche you can't do-anything to change the environment 
it is as is you can be mad you can be sad you-can be angry 
that's okay like there's nothing you can't modify-that you 
can't change that you just have to wait accept and wait 
till you can go-and help people surprise surprise this 
group too-experiences new opportunities as participating in 
these-environments day two um realize that they are capable 
of more than they-thought they could and day two more so 
than any group-realize how finite our life is they have 
rescued people of these mountains they-realize that they 
have to do as much as they can with the time that they 
do-have now I challenged you I made you go to Mars then we 
went to the cold Arctic-we should have went to the beach 
but we went to the-Arctic and then we went into our local 
Wilderness three very different-challenging extreme 
environments these individuals stepped out of their 
sandbox-they challenged themselves and they were okay 
remember they learned how to cope-those stressors theyve 
perceived the stress to be low they grew they changed-for 
the better so I challenge you to challenge yourself to step 
out of your-sandbox whatever they that may be because I 
know you are hearty I know you-are resilient and I know you 
can do way more than you thought possible thank-[Applause] 
you
