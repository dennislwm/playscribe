Hello Health Champions today I want to talk about how to 
get rid of belly fat-naturally and for good and there are 
two things that you absolutely must avoid to-get rid of 
belly fat and you probably heard of them they're called 
sugar and-stress and some people are going to say I already 
knew that next give me-something new someone else might be 
saying I don't believe that and it's-usually followed with 
something like because my grandpa always fill in the-blank 
always ate Candy always drank a bottle of whiskey every day 
he never-exercised he never ate vegetables and he lived 
into his 90s well that's maybe the-case but that doesn't 
mean that is optimal there's always a freak of nature-who 
can get away with a lot of things that doesn't mean that's 
how it works or-that's what we should do most people are 
probably going to say I believe that-sugar and stress is 
bad I understand that but it's so hard to deal with and 
a-lot of people believe that everything's okay in 
moderation and I tend to agree-with that but I might have a 
different opinion about what moderation is now the-problem 
is a lot of people are just always looking for the next 
thing they-think the answer lies in finding out one more 
thing one more biohack one more-magical supplement but I'm 
here to tell you that you don't need another list-that's 
not what it's about it's about knowing more if you haven't 
fixed the-problem yet if you're still eating sugar even 
though you know you shouldn't if-you're still having a lot 
of stress and you know you should do something about-it but 
you haven't then you need more information you need 
stronger-information that will give you a stronger why and 
there's this story-about a dog on a porch and he's just 
kind of half laying down and he's-whining and complaining 
and there are two guys on the porch the guest asks 
the-owner of the dog well why is your dog whining and 
complaining so much and the-owner says well right over 
where he is there's a nail and I bet it's hurting-him and 
then they keep talking and the dog keeps whining and 
complaining and-then the guest asks again well if it hurts 
why doesn't he just get up and-move to the spot and the 
owner says well it doesn't hurt that bad and that's how-a 
lot of us live our lives it doesn't hurt that bad yet we're 
not sick enough-yet so what we need to do if we know 
there's things we should do but we're-not doing them we 
need more reasons more information so we can create a 
stronger-why and that's what I want to do for you so let's 
start in with sugar most people-know that sugar is going to 
raise blood blood sugar that's typically the first-thing 
they're going to think of and the body needs to have a 
certain amount of-blood sugar in a certain range when we 
eat something that raises blood sugar-then the body has to 
bring it back down into a certain range and it uses 
insulin-to do that so now this blood glucose starts 
dropping and the more we tend to-increase the blood sugar 
quickly the more it tends to drop quickly and very-often we 
get a little overshoot and then we eat again and it drops 
again and we-eat again and so forth so every time that we 
have a large blood sugar Spike-we're going to release a 
large amount of insulin and if we do this over a 
long-period of time like several times a day for years and 
years now we're going to-develop insulin resistance and 
that's one way that we can develop insulin-resistance the 
second way is the fact that Sugar also has fructose in it 
it's-50% glucose 50% fructose in sugar and this fructose is 
different it doesn't-raise blood sugar but it can only be 
processed through the liver or it-doesn't raise blood sugar 
much I should say it very very slight increase but-because 
the liver is the only organ that can process this fructose 
it tends to-overwhelm the liver very quickly because we're 
eating amounts that never occurred-in a diet before the 
last 100 years so these are the two primary factors 
that-create insulin resistance but one thing that happens 
now is that because the-blood sugar Rises very quickly and 
has to be brought down very quickly the body-has to do 
something with all that glucose that we just ate all that 
fuel-and the Body Can Only Store a tiny little bit of 
glucose as glycogen so-most of this excess that we have 
every time we eat gets turned into fat some of-it gets 
turned into glycogen but over time more and more of it 
becomes fat and-that's called lipogenesis now another thing 
that happens is that we create-blood sugar swings as you 
can see from this graph when something comes up 
very-quickly it comes down very quickly then that is not 
what the body is looking for-the body is looking for a very 
stable level of blood sugar and when it rises-and Falls 
very quickly we tend to get what's called-hypoglycemia 
where on the bottom of this curve our blood sugar is too 
low and now-we get cranky and irritable and unfocused and 
we get Cravings but in-this video we're going to talk about 
sugar and stress and the thing to-understand is that blood 
sugar swings this high hypoglycemia is actually a-form of 
stress and I'm going to deal with that a little bit later 
in the-stress portion but a lot of you have been told that 
it's all about calories-if you want to lose weight if you 
want to lose belly fat then you just have to-eat fewer 
calories but that is unfortunately not how it works it's 
not-that it doesn't matter at all but the question is what 
sort of hormones are we-triggering because it's not the 
calories per se it's how the type of food we eat-trigger 
different metabolic and hormonal reactions so we just said 
that Sugar-will move you toward insulin resistance and when 
you're insulin resistant that-will increase your tendency 
for lipogenesis meaning making fat turning-carbohydrates 
into fat but it hits you from the other direction as well 
in that-it reduces lipolysis the breakdown of fat and that 
is your ability to turn fat-into energy so when you're 
healthy when you're metabolically healthy when 
you're-insulin sensitive then your ability to burn fat for 
energy and your ability to-store food as fat should be in 
balance and then of course if you're insulin-resistant or 
if you're overweight and you're trying to lose some weight 
then-the burning should be higher for a period of time 
until you're IM balance-and then you maintain it this way 
and it's kind of like a seesaw there but the-more insulin 
resistant you are the greater your tendency to store 
this-energy so it's going to go up and your burning ability 
will go down and the-more insulin resistant you are the 
more you're going to shift this out of-balance and what 
happens when everything you eat gets stored and you 
can't-retrieve it to turn that fat into energy what happens 
is you get hungrier and-most people don't realize this 
little fun fact they think that insulin-resistance is just 
an inability to control blood sugar because that's 
what-we're told and then we're given medication and Insulin 
to control the-blood sugar but when you're injecting 
insulin now you're shifting in this-imbalance even further 
and that's why calories per se don't matter it's not-the 
calories you get in Sugar it's the fact that they trigger 
these hormonal-and metabolic shifts so that you store more 
of them as fat and that you eat-more the calories in sugar 
make you eat even more calories the next problem is-that 
they are empty calories because with every type of food 
that you eat-your body wants to turn that into either 
energy or tissue and now the body needs-vitamins and 
minerals as catalysts to plug into these metabolic pathways 
but-with sugar you're not getting any of these vitamins and 
minerals they're-completely absent in Sugar so now your 
body says okay I got the raw fuel now I-need the cists to 
make this into energy but when it's missing the body is 
still-unsatisfied it knows that something was missing so 
it's going to create hunger-it's going to make you eat more 
hoping that you'll eat some real food and that-it's going 
to get those vitamins and minerals one more problem is that 
when-your insulin resistant then very often that's going to 
drive leptin resistance-so when we stuff a fat Cell full of 
fat full of energy that's the purpose it's-supposed to hold 
on to that energy and when it's full when it's satisfied 
then-it signals with leptin that I've had enough you can 
stop eating now but-leptin resistance means that we stuff 
the cell full but we're not getting the-message that we are 
full so we keep eating so when you're leptin resistant-now 
what's going to happen is even though you eat a bunch of 
food you have-less satiety less satisfaction less fullness 
which again-makes you eat more food so here's several 
different ways where it's not-about the calories it's about 
the type of food makes you eat more and we all-know this 
that there's always a little bit of room left over for a 
sugary-dessert even if we're super full for any other type 
of food as if that wasn't-enough sugar can also create 
what's called disbiosis and that's three-different word dis 
means out of balance bio means life and osis means 
condition-so it's a condition where the bacteria the life 
bacteria in your gut is out of-balance and how does this 
happen well there's different types you can have-disbiosis 
anywhere in your body you can have it on your skin you can 
have it in-your mouth and your stomach in your small 
intestine in your large intestine-basically everywhere 
there is bacterial culture that can get out of whack 
but-let's say that you eat something this is your neck your 
throat and it gets into-the stomach and then out of the 
stomach we-feed that into the small intestine and then the 
small intestine is going to go-on for a very long time 
about 20 feet worth and then it's going to dump into-the 
large intestine so here is something called the ilocal 
valve it's a little-flap that's supposed to close between 
the small intestine and the large-intestine and then once 
it gets into the large intestine-we get ready to dump 
everything and here's kind of how this-works that the large 
intestine is where most of the bacteria are supposed to 
be-so the small intestine is supposed to have something 
like thousands like 10 to-the3 power thousands of bacteria 
per cubic centimeter per milliliter so-that's a very small 
amount then the large-intestine normally has about 10 to 
the 9th billions of bacteria per cubic-centimeter so in 
other words there're supposed to be very very few bacteria 
in-the small intestine but a million times more in the 
large intestine now if this-ilocal valve isn't working 
quite right and stress can get it out of whack and-get it 
to not close and open properly now if we get a little bit 
of back flow-into the small intestine and then we eat a 
bunch of sugar and fast food now we-get what's called sibo 
or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and the-more sugar 
and the more processed food and more quick carbs we eat the 
worse-that sio overgrowth can get so the digestive tract is 
set up to do things-in an orderly fashion we start off with 
some acid in the stomach to start-breaking things down but 
then we put it into the small intestine where most-almost 
all the food is supposed to be absorbed so the 
carbohydrates the simple-carbs we break them into simple 
carbs they get absorbed we break down the-protein into 
amino acids and that gets absorbed in the small intestine 
and the-very complex carbohydrates and the fiber is 
primarily what makes it into the-large intestine and the 
simpler the carbohydrate is the higher up in the-digestive 
tract it's supposed to be absorbed but if we have sibo 
small-intestine bacterial overgrow and we feed them a bunch 
of sugar now-they're going to migrate higher and higher up 
and they're going to produce-toxic waste products and 
they're going to produce a lot of gas so they're going-to 
make hydrogen gas hydrogen sulfide gas and methane and 
these byproducts can-cause altered movement of the food 
stuff through the digestive tract called-peristalsis so it 
can slow it down or speed it up depending on what 
happening-so the problem with sibo or one of the problems 
is that we're supposed to have-thousands but with an 
overgrowth now we get hundreds of thousands or 
Millions-which is still a tiny amount compared to what's in 
the large intestine but it's a-different it's an abnormal 
culture it's an abnormal Flora so now in these-byproducts 
and these different bacteria these unbalanced bacteria 
migrate and-move forward into the large intestine now we 
can get that large intestine-unbalanced as well and that's 
one way that we can further unbalance the large-intestine 
we create disbiosis and we could have some pathogens 
develop in the-small intestine that now make it into the 
large intestine and start feasting-on the fiber that it 
shares with all the other bacteria there and why is 
this-such a big deal why do we care about this what's up 
with a little bit of-disbiosis well the effects of sibo and 
large intestine disbiosis are manyfold-so one thing that 
can happen is gas bloating and diarrhea or in some 
cases-constipation we can get a reduction in absorption of 
nutrients in the small-intestine and we could get 
nutritional deficiencies now in the large intestine-those 
bacteria if they're out of balance they actually make a lot 
of our vitamins-they make a lot of nutrients they package 
or repackage the nutrients for-us so that can also 
contribute to nutrient deficiencies we can get a-decrease 
in bacterial diversity and there's a lot of healthy species 
that-are supposed to keep the others in check and when we 
don't have enough of those-now we get pathogenic overgrow 
so the bad guys the things that make us sick-and toxic 
start overgrowing and that can lead to an irritation of the 
gut lining-both in the small and the large intestine we can 
get a leaky gut which-is primarily in the small intestine 
where we absorb a lot of this food but-when we have a leaky 
gut and things start spilling out into the bloodstream-that 
are not supposed to be there now we can also get things 
like systemic-inflammation so now with the leaky gut 
systemic inflammation we can also get a-lot of food 
allergies we move toward autoimmunity and this start 
poisoning it-starts spreading toxins into the rest of the 
body and there's something called a-gut brain axis that can 
get disrupted which means some of these toxins now-make it 
into the brain because if you have a leaky gut you're 
probably going-to develop a leaky brain because it's 
controlled by a lot of the same-mechanisms so now that's 
something called-neurotoxicity and they've done multiple 
studies where they inject people health-healthy people with 
just tiny tiny amounts of some of these toxins that-these 
bacteria produce and they instantly get anxiety and 
depression so-a lot of these symptoms have to do with the 
mechanisms that we're talking about-this often also leads 
to autoimmunity where your immune system gets confused-by 
all this chaos and starts attacking your own tissues and 
when your bacteria-get out of balance they are actually 
respons responsible for a lot of your-metabolic signaling 
so now we can get altered metabolic signaling and 
things-like appetite regulation and leptin and gin the 
leptin is a Sati hormone gin is-the hunger hormones and now 
both of these can get out of balance and start-affecting 
you so that your hunger and your Cravings may not actually 
be-Cravings that you have but it's your gut bacteria 
telling you that hey I have-cravings you better go eat 
something and this altered metabolic signaling 
also-involves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity so 
with the wrong kind of-bacteria you can become more insulin 
resistant just from that so sugar is one-of the absolute 
worst things that you can eat but I also want to touch 
on-something called necessary versus sufficient so sugar is 
a huge problem-it's not the only problem so yes it is 
necessary to cut out the sugar but-unfortunately it may not 
be sufficient that if you have enough pathogens if you-have 
enough imbalances you can't fix that probably without 
taking out the-sugar but there may not be sufficient there 
may be other things that you have-to do as well to get the 
balance back to get rid of some of those pathogens if-it's 
gone far enough so let's talk about stress and what that 
actually is that-stress at the most fundamental level in 
your nervous system is something called-sympathetic 
Activation so you have two branches to your automatic 
your-autonomic nervous system one is fight flight the other 
is feed breed now the-fight flight that's the sympathetic 
it kicks in when it thinks you're in danger-and that's why 
sugar and stress have a lot to do with each other because 
sugar-is the emergency fuel whenever your body is under 
danger it thinks it needs more-energy more sugar then it 
starts looking for that it tries to raise blood sugar-so 
let's talk about hypoglycemia like I said a little-earlier 
that hypoglycemia is actually a form of stress and that 
when you're-supposed to have your blood sugar in a certain 
range and then your blood sugar-Rises and Falls then every 
time that it's-in the bottom when it's bottoming out here 
your body is under stress and-because it's very very 
important to bring it up again then everything under-the 
curve here is a form of metabolic stress and your body is 
going to produce-cortisol it's a stress hormone that it's 
primary function is to raise blood sugar-and get it back 
into that range or when we are stressed when we have a 
high-strong sympathetic response now it tries to bring it a 
little bit toward the-higher end of normal so that you have 
a little extra fuel but the cor cortisol-is the hormone 
that does this so whether you're trying to bring it up a 
little-because you're stressed or because you're 
hypoglycemic it makes no-difference it's still a form of 
stress that results in cortisol and once again-Nature has 
been really really brilliant in designing this because if 
you have a-wild animal chasing you and you need more energy 
your body releases cortisol-the glucose goes up but because 
you're being chased you're running you're-expanding you're 
using up all that energy so you don't need insulin to-break 
it down because a working muscle is going to suck up that 
glucose-naturally so it's a perfect cycle perfect set set 
up so to speak but if-you are not running from a wild 
animal if you have more chronic stress if-you're sitting in 
traffic if you're stressed because you can't pay the 
bill-or someone is messing with you now that glucose is not 
being absorbed by the-muscles and you need to release 
insulin and this is how chronic stress drives-insulin 
resistance and because it does that it's also part of 
driving metabol-syndrome and it contributes to increased 
blood pressure type 2 diabetes central-obesity meaning 
you're packing on most of the weight in the middle 
the-dangerous the organ fat the visceral fat and it also 
drives dyslipidemia meaning-cholesterol that is out of 
balance it's not just if it's high or low but it's if-it's 
inflamed if the LDL particles are too small and damaged 
from that-inflammation and here are some more cortisol 
effects it will make you eat-more because your body is 
trying to generate energy to get through this-dangerous 
situation and raise some blood sugar so cortisol is one way 
to do it-but it also triggers you to try to find something 
sweet to increase blood sugar-that way as well and 
therefore you're going to have cravings for things that-can 
raise blood sugar fast so you have more of a tendency to 
eat things that-aren't good for you like sugary and 
processed foods high glycemic foods-Comfort foods and by 
that mechanism it's also going to increase your tendency 
for-emotional eating and through all these mechanisms that 
we've talked about-making fat out of carbohydrate Etc 
increasing-lipogenesis it will also increase fat 
storage-the cortisol will very forcefully Drive fat storage 
and unfortunately it does it-in the abdominal cavity 
especially so this visceral fat we talked about 
it-especially stimulates some enzymes to turn it into fat 
in the abdominal area-and when the cortisol is trying to 
increase the blood sugar now normally-this doesn't happen 
but with chronic stress and very high levels of cortisol-it 
will part of what it's using to make glucose is going to be 
protein so-there's a disease where people have very very 
high levels of cortisol and what-happens now is they start 
breaking down protein which means muscle so these-people 
are going to have a huge belly where they store all that 
fat they're-going to have skinny arms and legs they're 
going to have a flat butt-because they're eating up the 
protein with the cortisol to turn it into-glucose and then 
that glucose drives up the insulin and the insulin stores 
the-fat primarily in the midsection and also when you're 
stressed your frontal lobe-your Executive Center of the 
brain is not working as well and one thing that-recites in 
the frontal lobe is motivation so with higher cortisol 
with-higher stress you're also going to have less 
motivation to go do things that are-good for you such as 
exercise and now that comes back to bite you-because with 
less motivation to exercise now of course you're going to 
exercise-less but exercise was one of the things that could 
drive the frontal lobe to-give you more motivation so now 
with less exercise it gets back to have even-less 
motivation and now you exercise even less you drive the 
front the lobe-even less and so on and so on and one more 
thing that cortisol does is it will-ruin your sleep because 
the hormone that helps you sleep that regulates your-sleep 
cycle is called melatonin it's released by your pineal 
gland right in-the middle of your head and that kind of 
makes sense that cortisol completely-shuts off that 
melatonin because if you're in danger obviously you 
don't-want to fall asleep you want to be bright and alert 
and awake to deal with-that danger so as long as cortisol 
is high then you're not going to sleep all-that well so I 
hope I've given you some things to think about so that you 
can-strengthen your motivation and your resolve to do 
something about sugar and-stress and if you're ready for 
that then let's talk about how to do this it's-really quite 
simple once you understand why things happen and how the 
body works-and what these things do then it's not all that 
difficult so I recommend you-eliminate all added sugar look 
for added sugar if it's more than a gram per-serving then 
don't eat it also eliminate all sweet juices and I know 
that there's-some good things in juice but there's also too 
much sugar it's a sugar bomb if-you occasionally make some 
green juice and don't over sweeten it that's-probably fine 
but don't buy into the idea that orange juice is 
something-that's good for you then you want to reduce sweet 
fruit so tropical fruit-fruit that's very high in sugar 
it's not that you can't ever have it but the more-insulin 
resistant you are the more you want to reduce it and you 
want to-emphasize having maybe some berries instead like a 
handful of berries just-has a fraction of the sugar that 
you're going to get in sweet fruit then you-want to reduce 
the processed foods because that's where you're going 
to-find most of the added sugar and the preservatives and 
the seed oils and all-that garbage and if you want to 
reduce it by 100% that's absolutely fine that-would be a 
great thing but just don't do like the average person where 
they get-60 70% of their calories from ultr processed foods 
with high macronutrients-high carb High seed oil high sugar 
and very very low or non-existent nutrients-so I don't 
think that you have to avoid void it completely if you can 
handle it-some people can't have a little bit then they 
fall right back into it but I think-that you should have at 
least 90 maybe 95% of your food should be real whole-food 
and the processed stuff should be a rare exception then to 
deal with stress-I strongly recommend breathing exercises 
because once you have a stress response-your body fires off 
and you're making hormones you're making stress 
hormones-you're negating your immune system for hours and 
hours and hours after that-even if it was just a very brief 
episode of stress whereas if you do something-like a 
breathing exercise if you consciously calm yourself down 
now you-can reset your body and these stress hormones go 
back to normal in minutes a-couple of minutes instead of 
staying up for hours and hours and the more you do-these 
breathing exercises the more you train train your body to 
return to that-state automatically I also strongly 
recommend meditation because it can-change your mindset it 
can change your outlook in addition to the 
breathing-exercises it goes a little bit deeper in 
silencing your mind and reducing that-stress and then I 
suggest that you plan out your sleep and your exercise 
don't-just let it happen by default make it really really 
important that you sleep-at a certain time when you can and 
that you exercise at certain times at regular-times when 
you can and you want to make all of this really important 
don't just-do it when you get around to it use all the 
information and all the nudging that-I've given you to 
create some goals make a resolve and a decision and make 
it-really really important because you're worth it if you
