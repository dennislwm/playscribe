[Music] welcome back to off the pulpit I'm-Andrea she's 
beus the Cruz and if it's the first time you're watching 
off the-pulpit well we invite members of our clergy to help 
us discuss matters of-faith and today's discussion really 
is part two of an episode on the pope and-the papacy last 
week we heard and learned who the pope is what the 
papacy-is and where the pope gets his authority so we have 
once again father uh IGI-father ignacius yo is here to help 
us brush up on our knowledge of the Pope in-preparation for 
the visit of Pope Francis to Singapore in September yes 
so-Figi is Parish priest of St Anthony of padwa he's 
professor of liturgy at the-St Francis Xavier Seminary here 
in Singapore and he's also very very busy-because his chair 
of the AR season lurgy commission and Master of Ceremonies 
for-our major liturgical celebrations in the AR seies which 
includes the people Mass-yes so thank you so much father 
for coming on and uh sharing with us again-about you know 
always very happy to be here thank you Father we are 
happy-you're here too so we have to ask this question 
because people mask right we're-talking about the pope so 
share with us father who Pope Francis is and how did-he 
become the head of the Catholic Church yes and so who is 
Pope Francis-Pope Francis is the 266 Bishop of Rome 
successor of St Peter-Pope Francis was elected to the 
papacy on March the 13-2013 to replace po Benedict the 16 
who resigned from the office of the papacy 2-weeks earlier 
and the team said have come to Define pope francis's 
papacy-include poverty mercy and joying probably that's why 
he chose this name-Francis now the name Francis is the pap 
name of ho Mario-bolio who is actually the actual name of 
Pope Francis right now this change of-name as he has became 
and was elected Pope is a-significant change in his life it 
marks that significant change and similarly it-marks a 
significant change in our lives especially when one enters 
into baptism-of confirmation we get that from St Paul 
himself right after his Encounter of-Christ his name was 
changed from Saul to Paul so it actually Abraham also 
right-yeah Abram to AB yes Abraham ah yeah very good go all 
all the way-back so Pope Francis or bolio was born in bonus 
Aris Argentina to Two Italian-immigrants and so actually he 
was he's of Italian descent and he was born on-December 17 
1936 he holds Advanced degrees in-chemistry philosophy 
theology so he's actually a very learned man as well 
now-before starting his Seminary education he work as a 
janitor a bar bouncer you-know and a labing for cist 
happening man and so-that's why you can see his character 
he's very he is quite big as wellig you-know yeah sturdy 
stury I would say so even 88 years old he's making 
his-longest journey yeah right yeah this is the longest 
longest journey especially-he's coming Singapore yeah so 
and so after several years of study he entered-the Society 
of Jesus or known as the Jesuits in-1958 after finishing 
his initial training as a Jesuit he took vows of-poverty 
Chastity and obedience and became a Jesuit on the 12th of 
March-1960 it was ordained to the priesthood almost 10 
years later in December-1969 so he's the pope first pope 
that is ordain post Vatican 2-ah and so and prior from 
going to Rome he served several roles as Bishop 
of-Argentina and became the Metropolitan Archbishop he was 
made Cardinal in 2001-by Pope John Paul II and he held 
several administrative positions within the-Roman curier 
governing body of the Catholic church right oh wow okay 
so-that is really the man uh as you described him 
father-but the Holy Father has certain I would 
say-Hallmarks or or or themes uh of his papacy or his time 
in office um some-themes that come to mind and and and 
these I feel as I said are things that-stand out right uh 
but they also speak about I feel about the heart of the 
man-M now speaking about this key theme themes of the life 
of Pope Francis and-yeah what comes to my mind I feel I 
just these are not just Hallmarks of Pope-Francis but truly 
his heart his personality right right they they speak-of 
the heart of this man whom we call the pope and his mission 
for God and the-church so the first thing that come to my 
mind as you speak about Pope Francis-is Pope Francis is the 
champion for the poor right and we see it also in one 
of-his quotations he said you pray for the poor then you 
feed them that is how-prayer works this is what Pope 
Francis said wow and so he has always been very-conscious 
that what underscores our life as Christian in our-mission 
is action for the poor not just mere words of option for 
the poor so-don't just talk the talk doesn't walk the walk 
so and in he's walking that-walk he's always a champion for 
the poor wow secondly uh po Francis is also the-advocate of 
environment we all know stewards of God's creation we 
are-called to make the earth a beautiful garden for 
Humanity so in 2015 Pope-Francis wrote La see know and a 
major document on the need to protect the-environment of 
fath the dangers and challenges of climate change in order 
to-reduce the use of fossil fuels then in a 7,000 Word 
document-called which is a followup on his document of-2015 
it prompt it was prompted by extreme weather events since 
then which-he called the Earth's cries of-protest and the 
PO and so po Francis appealed again in their document 
to-climate change deniers and food dragging politicians to 
have a change of heart-saying climate change and his human 
causes cannot be denied yeah so he-actually lives up to the 
name Francis Francis himself loves creation correct-correct 
so you can see how he himself as the pope then lives up to 
that not only-their name but then his mission as well 
correct in this modern time mod time-yeah wow thirdly Pope 
Francis is also the bridge builder you know there 
is-however one title we hear applied to Pope Francis and 
also to all popes and-is perhaps something of a mystery to 
many we call him and we called popes the-pontiff is a very 
curious word oh yes the meaning of which may not be 
readily-understood our parent but it it comes from the 
Latin word pontifex which means-bridge builder so the pope 
is known as the ponteix-Maximus meaning the great bridge 
builder and so more often than not then we see-images of 
Pope Francis Building Bridges by reaching-out like making 
this paper trip reach out right and he Reach Out reach out 
to-bless children to comfort those who are visibly poor in 
health or who suffer-from some physical disability those 
images of Po Francis-tenderly embracing so many might be 
easily marginalized in everyday society-and our images of 
Pope Francis as the bridge-builder and so as Pope Francis 
did then we are also called to do to be Bridge-Builders to 
reach out to the poor to the marginalized fourthly Pope 
Francis is-also the proponent of Peace m in his first 
message on-2016 Pope Francis summoned Humanity to show 
compassion and to transcend the-apathy that impedes peace 
in a world that has been filled of late with-conflict 
suffering and Wars yeah the pope told thousands of faithful 
gathered-in St Peter Square in that in Angeles message 
today we celebrate the world day-of peace whose name is 
overcome-indifference and win peace peace had to be 
cultivated and warn he said beginning-with spiritual 
struggles that starts within our hearts and so in order to 
be-proponents of Peace we must have peace ourselves correct 
and so it begins with-us a conversion of our own hearts and 
so the pope emphasized that it is humility-then that brings 
peace in a world world and in the church where where 
humility-is lacking there is war Discord and division he 
said God has given us the-example of humility in his son 
Jesus and Mary for our Salvation happiness and-humility is 
precisely the way and the path to-Salvation wow you know 
recently um there was um there was a headline that uh 
said-you know the Holy Father is distressed yeah about what 
is happening-in the Middle East the you know I mean I mean 
we can understand why I mean he's-such a proponent of Peace 
yes that the war in the Middle East has distressed-him I 
mean I thought that wow that's a powerful word to describe 
what he must-really be feeling yes and I guess again when 
you chose the name Francis St-Francis himself was a man of 
Peace abolutely Lord make me an instrument of-Peace of 
Peace nice like CH of your peace and I guess through his 
example-and also through all his papal Journeys that is 
what he wants to imbu in the-hearts of all that he meet 
yeah okay wow okay so now that we know a-little bit uh 
better about our Pope Pope Francis father how can we 
prepare for-the holy father's visit to Singapore I think 
we're definitely in the midst of-you know preparing we are 
preparing a lot in some way in some way I think one-of the 
things is the balloting of tickets definitely you know like 
oh this-one must do must do you know yeah but what are 
other ways that we can truly-prepare our hearts to uh for 
Pope francis's visit yeah listen to this-podcast again and 
again so that you know who Pope Francis is-and in uh 
interiorize for ourselves the symbol that he is for 
the-world and for the church okay but quoting and 
paraphrasing our Archbishop-he says the Holy Father comes 
to proclaim the good news of the Gospel to-everyone not 
only his sheep which is the flock of Christ in addition 
to-rekindling our faith and deepening our understanding 
what it means to be-Catholic he continues to say he prays 
that the presence of the Holy Father-will encourage us to 
work together as Christ's missionaries and spreading 
the-good news to every corner of the globe these are the 
words of cardinal William-go when he learned about the news 
of the confirmation of the Holy father's visit-to Singapore 
and so it seems like a tall-order for us but being also the 
year of prayer right in preparation for the-great Jubilee 
and that is why Pope Francis is making this journey even 
in-his old age reaching out to Nations we should 
then-intensify our prayer and seek conversion in our own 
personal lives firstly by-going for the sacrament of 
confession cuz there we receive the grace of God-why 
because conversion must first and foremost be internally in 
our own-lives right because we cannot give what we 
ourselves do not have and with this-grace of God then let 
us seek to be like Pope Francis a champion of the 
poor-advocate of the environment a bridge builder a 
proponent of Peace so that the-great juble of 2025 will 
indeed be for us and for all-mankind a hope that does not 
disapp Point actually we are so blessed that-he's coming 
yes just before the jub and I mean it really is an 
opportunity for-us to like you said father to prepare 
ourselves actually I mean there's a lot-of busyness in all 
the preparations but it's the spiritual preparation that 
if-we forget that then all of what we are doing is comes to 
not really actually-because the church in celebrating the 
great Jubilee there going to be another-program absolutely 
where God pours out his grace into our hearts and we must 
be-prepared for the outpouring of that grace of God 
correct-correct okay you see so much dear sisters and 
brothers so this is not just-someone who's coming by uh 
it's not going to be another you know hello-Swifty concert 
or anything of that sort you know uh it's going to say 
hello and-goodbye swiftly come swiftly go uh in fact in 
fact in fact I mean really-it's the first time a pope is 
going to spend so much time uh in truly blessed-yeah with 
us and so wow we are truly yeah truly truly truly blessed
