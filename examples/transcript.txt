hello my name is Father Gregory Pine and I'm a Dominican 
frier of the province of-St Joseph I teach at the Dominican 
House of studies and I work for theistic-institute and this 
is Pine of the coinus Recently I was invited to the 
apartment-of a friend uh for like a little house preaching 
event so she had invited maybe-a dozen of her friends many 
of whom are not Christian uh and so my task was to-set 
forward something that was you know charismatic that is to 
say which-proclaimed our Lord Jesus Christ uh but also 
appealing to those who may have-never heard Christ 
proclaimed before or may have heard Christ proclaimed 
before-but you know weren't drawn by that or weren't 
attracted by that so I decided-to speak a little bit about 
relationships um because in these-circumstances my kind of 
instinct is to try to find a handhold in their Humanity-um 
because yeah the natural laws at work in each human heart 
and we are all of us-driven by similar you know instincts 
or by a similar openness to reality and I-think one thing 
that resonates with all of us is the desire to be in 
meaningful-relationships or purposeful relationships so I 
thought that you know-having thought about these things I 
might share them with you as well so-these are three 
approaches to relationships here we-go okay so we would 
like to have good relationships I think many of us 
would-like to have good relationships that's a starting 
point point and I think that-you can just assert that 
because many people just recognize it as yeah okay-totally 
for sure self-evident um there are some people-who will not 
concede that who will say no not interested in meaningful 
or-purposeful relationships but I think it's only after 
having had or having-suffered many failed attempts right so 
after having suffered abuse or trauma or-disappointment or 
dismay of whatever sort but I think that like when you 
kind-of get through the layers of sadness and anger you'll 
find still-a kind of openness to relationship because we're 
made for relationship so-you've heard it said like man is a 
political animal that's Aristotle or-you've heard it said 
man is a social animal that's a lot of people but St-Thomas 
says it um we are made to live in relationships and we only 
come to our-perfection in relationships okay so then what 
makes for a good relationship here-we could get super 
specific or super fine grain but I think it's it's 
almost-better to describe it with broad brush Strokes or to 
paint with broad brush-Strokes I think a lot of us want to 
be close to-another uh we want to share our lives we want 
to experience some aome of freedom-in relationships we want 
to Delight I think like um most basically or 
most-instinctually I want somebody else closer to me than 
my sadness and anger-like I want somebody near to me so 
that I know that I'm not alone I don't think-any of us want 
to be alone uh because when we experience Our Lives as 
alone-it's kind of terrible so yeah I want somebody to 
be-close I want someone with whom to share I want someone 
who encourages in me a-certain freedom and for whom I 
encourage a certain freedom and I want somebody-with whom I 
can Delight in life in experience in God okay so here are 
my-three kind of proposals or my three ways of going about 
it um and they get better-and better uh so the first would 
be like common courtesy this is just a most-basic way in 
which to interact with another person or to have a 
relationship-with another person and you know this would be 
the kind of relationship of-pleasantries the kind of 
relationship that you have with the cashier or the-kind of 
relationship that you have with the bank teller and the 
point here is-just kind of like get through life together 
uh or to get through this-encounter together uh and so 
we're largely contented if we avoid conflict-like we don't 
want to get upset uh we don't want to let's say we're 
driving-down the highway and there are other people on the 
road we just don't want to-get in an accident or we want to 
have our road rage stirred up or we don't-want to have an 
unpleasant experience which will stick with us for 
many-minutes or for many hours hence uh yeah that'll 
distract us or otherwise-disperse us okay so in these 
situations we kind of just like focus on the-boundaries of 
the other and I try not to transgress those boundaries uh 
The-Virtue here as you can kind of tell is is tolerance all 
right so people are-doing their things I'm doing my thing 
we're just trying not to get in the way-we're just trying 
not to cause conflict okay so you know it's fine uh it's 
not-bad I think it's good to be tolerant of certain 
differences but tolerance-doesn't really seek to change 
oneself or the other because yeah there's just a-kind of 
understanding that it's really hard to change both oneself 
and the-other and that you're probably not going to change 
either yourself or the other-and so tolerance can only get 
you so far it gets you a kind of low-grade-closeness it's 
like here we are both on the highway and we are not running 
into-each other or of lowgrade delight you know you can 
have like a pleasant-encounter with a bank teller and 
you're like yeah that was a pleasant encounter-with a bank 
teller cheers to us the image that I want to use to 
describe all-three is two people in boats all right two 
little boter uh so here you know-under this standard of 
common courtesy the two little boers are focusing on 
not-crashing okay not getting into an accident or not 
causing a wake that will-swamp the other boats so the basic 
idea is like get long in life without causing-other people 
problems okay so you know Pleasant enough you know the 
difference-between a good Boer a respectful Boer and a bad 
Boer a disrespectful Boer and-you want to avoid the latter 
okay boating what a blessing if you are-interested in boats 
and boating there is a Gods spaning episode about just 
that-theme all right uh so that's the first common courtesy 
the second then would be-the standard of common interests 
okay it it it goes beyond mere tolerance if we-want to host 
a real conversation and you know talk about real things 
okay so I'm-not just trying to avoid conflict here I'm 
actually trying to invest all right-and the other person is 
trying to invest or I'm trying to engage and the 
other-person is trying to engage and the focus here is 
typically on common insights or-common experiences so 
you've heard it said-before that friends see the same thing 
or that friends embrace the same-thing um in in effect uh 
yeah we're we're going to make-some kind of effort to share 
our experience all right to share our lives-and the hope is 
that the other person would receive that and that they 
would-reciprocate that and that we could receive it in turn 
their kind of-Engagement or their investment um so it might 
be that your-interests aren't especially interesting or the 
others interests aren't-especially interesting fine uh you 
might exhaust your interests and come to-discover that you 
don't have too terribly much to stay and pass a lot of-time 
in silence but at root or kind of at its foundation there's 
an effort all-right there's an effort to invest an effort 
to engage all right in the virtue-here we can call like 
friendliness you might have heard it described in 
fancier-terms like affability or amicability all right but 
we can see already at the-outset that this gets you further 
all right this gets you a kind-of like medium grade 
closeness or a medium grade-Delight uh and and we enjoy a 
kind of relationship like this with many of our-friends uh 
so it's not it's not bad it's it's good but then we can 
also see that-there are certain limitations okay so then 
returning to our image of two-little boers I don't know why 
I'm just killing myself right now um here you-have you know 
guys which will they they'll squat up right I'll lash to 
my-I'll lash my boat to your boat you'll lash your your 
boat to my boat and we'll-for whatever period of time kind 
of float together whether down the river-you know we're 
thinking here like the Great American Beer Float which I 
just-witnessed people doing on the danu river the other day 
um or whatever else right-so it it's just some kind of 
spending of time or sharing of insights or seeing-the same 
thing embracing the same thing but still we're we're each 
staying in-our boats because they're little boats our 
little lives aren't too terribly-capacious in this kind of 
understanding as it were of relationship um but-there's 
there's a real attempt to share at some level I lash my 
boat to yours-you lash your boat to mine and we float on 
together while hosting a common-conversation and seeing 
what comes of it okay so those are our first two 
common-courtesy and common interests then we arrive at our 
third standard which is a-common goal so in this 
understanding we set out-together towards a common horizon 
or we actually take up together a common-purpose right a 
common meaning and what we find is that when-this is your 
standard you get the other two things-all right so you 
avoid conflict and you're able to share interests 
whether-that be insights or experiences or whatever else 
okay so um let's let's Bop-over to our boater here for a 
second uh let's say that like two boers-spend all our time 
trying to avoid conflict they're just going to make a-lot 
of adjustments right they're going to be like paddling this 
way and-paddling that way so as to avoid you know knocking 
into each other uh because-the water is somewhat 
tempestuous or the water is somewhat choppy and 
they're-going to have to make those constant adjustments 
but they're they're really-spending all of their energy 
making those adjustments because otherwise-they're just 
floating okay then when it comes to like you know common 
interests-yeah my boat is lashed to yours your boat is 
lashed to mine we're sharing-we're enjoying but you you see 
how we can have a richer sharing or a richer-enjoyment when 
we proceed towards a common-Horizon because we're taking 
for our view of Life the same thing all right so-we're 
trying to see life in the same way we're trying to proceed 
in life-according to the same way so obviously that's going 
to generate more in the way-of common interests or more in 
the way of common experiences because we're-trying to live 
life after the same manner so then in being governed by 
a-common Pursuit we have a greater certainty or confidence 
in the other-because we're both drawn to something Beyond 
us uh that organizes as it were-our relationship and we can 
become one as a result in a more profound way or in-a more 
meaningful purposeful way so you see how the virtue at work 
here-especially in the Christian sense would be love all 
right so I will the good for-myself and I will the same 
good for you I also will my sharing it your sharing-it our 
sharing in it all right so it's like we both see a thing as 
estimable as-worthy as good for Pursuit and then that 
animates our response I go out towards-it kind of 
ecstatically as it were and you go out towards it 
ecstatically as it-were so we go out towards it and we can 
share in it by virtue of the fact that-you proceed towards 
that Horizon it doesn't diminish my proceeding towards-that 
Horizon we're both caught up in the same Pursuit and so we 
can share in it-so you see here like there's something else 
that's going on there's something-bigger Bolder more 
beautiful still that's going on uh and so turning-towards 
our two little boers we've already mentioned some of their 
their-Pursuits but you can see how like when they proceed 
towards the same point on-the horizon they're going to have 
to make fewer adjustments and they're not-going to have to 
like worry about lashing their boats together 
because-they'll be drawn together by that common point on 
the horizon if they proceed-towards the same port then they 
can trust that when they arrive there-together that they 
will be together all right but the Excellence of the 
pursuit-it it it's a matter of the Excellence of the actual 
goal right the the thing that-they choose to pursue so you 
know like your goal might be the accumulation of-money 
right business partners do just this or your goal might be 
the-accumulation of delightful experiences right there are 
plenty of members of you-know intermural teams or pick up 
sports teams that that have this for their goal-but when 
you take for your end God himself you can see how it 
outpaces all-of our human Pursuits and as a result of which 
it can beet a-union um and then a sharing a closeness a 
nearness a delight a freedom which-outpaces every other 
Human Experience so then within our Christian 
understanding-we speak of our Pursuits as as just such 
right that we pursue God and we do so in-the setting of the 
mystical body and that we enjoy a real Union as an 
organic-feature of our Christian lives which spells for us 
the end of jealousy and-envy I don't begrudge you the gifts 
that you have because I see them as-pertaining to my own 
salvation and you don't begrudge me the gifts that I 
have-because you see them as pertaining to your own 
salvation and it's also the end-of alienation because we 
take up our place and we play our role in the-mystical body 
so we actually have each other in differentiated fashion 
mind you-God gives different gifts but we have each other 
in a real way in an abiding-way and this begets in us a 
closeness a sharing a freedom a delight which is-awesome 
right which is transcendant and I think about this so-like 
by way of concluding point I was thinking about this 
recently because I-was preaching to some women who have 
sons in religious life right so moms of-Religious brothers 
and religious priests um and I think that like for a lot 
of-parents whose Sons become priests or whose Sons become 
religious you know-whose daughters become religious as well 
uh there can be like a kind of on the-one hand excitement 
if they're Pious and devout it's like cool this like 
Faith-thing that I have embraced has taken real root in the 
life of my son or-daughter but there also can be like a 
kind of sadness and anger because family-life the logic of 
family life is like we're together Let's Stay Together 
and-then Here Comes God and says Whoop I'm going to pluck 
up your favorite son or-your favorite daughter deal with it 
you're like what the heck all right and-so the Temptation I 
think for a parent is to say ah I'm not going to talk 
about-the fact that I feel sad and angry because that's 
embarrassing and it-doesn't fit within the pious or The 
Devout story um but I'm just going to-like try to hold on 
to my son or hold on to my daughter so I can keep what 
little-of him or her is Left To Me by virtue of this 
vocation and so you'll see parents-like trying to pull 
their kids back like trying to perpetuate family 
traditions-that just don't fit in religious life or trying 
to like you know get extra-vacations that just don't fit in 
relig what whatever else okay you can see how-this works 
out and so I was encouraging these women um to not fall 
into that-trap because when that happens then you're in 
Conflict right when that-happens then you lack common 
interests right what what what's actually-happening is that 
you're drifting apart in trying to stay together whereas 
you-see the efficacy of this common goal Paradigm or this 
common goal standard-that if that mother chooses to give 
herself more wholeheartedly to God then-she gets her son 
albeit in a very different way there-might still be sadness 
there might still be anger but provided that she 
is-proceeding towards the same Horizon then she has that 
son or daughter who is also-proceeding towards you know 
that Horizon um and so I think about it in-these terms it's 
like yeah when you're son makes a sacrifice your 
daughter-makes a sacrifice you can make a sacrifice not 
only of yourself but you-can make a sacrifice of your son 
or daughter you can give God your son or-daughter in a new 
way right you did it baptism you did it confirmation but 
here-you can do it in a new way and you can give yourself 
in giving your son or-daughter and then you can have your 
daughter on those terms right as an-offering as a sacrifice 
because you are then United in the same Pursuit 
right-towards the same Horizon that is to say the Embrace 
of the same God so why do I-bring all this up because I 
think that in our experience of relationships we-want to be 
close right we want to share we want to experience a modum 
of Freedom-we want to experience some modum of delight but 
if we're always focused on-avoiding conflict or just simply 
AB in at the level of shared interests that is-to say 
seeing the same thing embracing the same thing there'll 
always be-something lacking to our relationships because 
you can only have each other-wholly and fully if you 
proceed towards the same goal and if you find each other-in 
the same God because God is the only good that cannot be 
exhausted by our-Pursuits or in whom we ourselves are 
undiminished as we are taken up into him-that might sound a 
little abstract but the basic point is that in God you 
get-God you get yourself and you get the Beloved and you 
can do do so with a kind-of Reckless abandon and freedom 
with a kind of wild Delight right in a way that-abides or 
in a way that that be gets a true sharing and a 
true-closeness because only God you know like defies the 
somewhat materialistic or-reductionistic terms of our 
experience at present so yeah I hope that's-somewhat 
helpful to you um and I hope that was somewhat helpful to 
the people-at my friend's apartment all right Squad know of 
my prayers for you please pray-for me and uh I'll look 
forward to chatting with you next time on pins of-the 
coinus although I'm supposed to make announcements at the 
end N I don't know-that I'm too terribly interested in 
those announcements so uh yeah catch you-later peace
