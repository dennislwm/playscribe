glory to Jesus Christ I'm mother Natalia a Byzantine 
Catholic nun from Christ the-bridegroom Monastery and this 
is Pines with-aquinus our community is friends with a 
Coptic Orthodox community of nuns who-live pretty close to 
us and one time when we were we were spending an-afternoon 
with them one of the nuns shared with us that she has 
this-practice of in order to more fully pray the Psalms and 
make the Psalms more a-part of her day she'll sometimes 
incorporate the Psalms-into the Jesus prayer so the Jesus 
prayer is this very ancient-prayer that many of the fathers 
have used and it's more or less there are-different 
variations but it's more or less Lord Jesus Christ Son of 
God have-mercy on me a sinner so what this particular nun 
will do is she'll take a-verse from the psalm and 
incorporate it into that prayer and pray it kind of 
on-repeat to let the words sink into her heart and I I kind 
of adopted this-practice and and have found it to be really 
fruitful in my own-life one of my favorite verses from the 
Psalms is from Psalm 61 in the-Septuagint 62 in the Hebrew 
numbering and it's it's in both verses 1 and five-for God 
Alone my soul waits in silence for God Alone my soul waits 
in-silence so I will often just during the day maybe 
while-I'm doing dishes or if I go for a walk or something 
like that I'll incorporate-this Psalm into the Jesus prayer 
and say Lord Jesus Christ Son of-God my soul Waits For You 
in silence Lord Jesus Christ Son of God my soul-Waits For 
You in silence and as I was-praying as I was praying that 
form of the Jesus prayer with this particular-Psalm it was 
really on my heart to do an episode about our need 
for-silence and I don't know probably some of you have-have 
heard a lot said about how we need more silence in our 
world today and in-our lives uh but I I might have a couple 
things to say that are are different-from what you've 
already heard so I don't know we'll see if not-then sorry I 
think part of the-problem part of the reason we maybe don't 
think we needs-silence is because we don't have it so so 
what I mean by that-is we are not recollected enough to 
realize that we need silence-in our lives an analogy that 
might help to to-kind of explain this several years ago I 
was doing something in the kitchen and-one of the nuns was 
cooking something on the stove top so they had the 
microwave-fan going as they're cooking to help with the 
smoke right-and as I'm working in the kitchen I'm chopping 
vegetables or whatever and this-microwave fan is going I'm 
thinking nothing of it I'm just going about my-work and 
then at some point then n turns the fan off because 
she's-done and the fan goes off and my whole body-relaxes 
my heart rate goes down and I realize the entire time 
the-fan was going there was some level of anxiety in me 
that I was totally unaware-of and and I wasn't aware of it 
until it was-gone and I think similarly we often don't know 
how much-we're being impacted by the noise until we step 
away from-it and then once we step away from it and things 
slow-down then we realize our minds have been going 100 Mil 
an-hour we haven't actually taken any time at all to see 
what's happening inside of-us you know it's like that 
feeling when you sit down at the end of a-day and you 
didn't even realize how tired you were you didn't realize 
how-exhausted your body was until you sat and then and then 
you realize oh wow I-haven't sat for 8 hours the difference 
between prayer and-the microwave analogy is that 
the-silence the external silence that we enter into to-pray 
can often amplify the anxiety so instead of I step away 
from-the noise and the anxiety is gone it's I step away 
from the xiety and-it's Amplified and part of the reason 
for-that is because we're now undistracted from the-anxiety 
we're undistracted from the stress and the-noise and we 
have to actually confront it so how should we-respond when 
we sit in silence and we're suddenly aware of all of 
the-anxiety and all of the troubles and all of the-stress 
well I think what we don't do is try to distract ourselves 
from it-which is what we do with the noise itself we use it 
as a-distraction so if I'm sitting in silence and I'm just 
really uncomfortable with-the silence I'm uncomfortable 
with my own thoughts-the answer is not to pick up the phone 
to pick up a-book sometimes it's not even to pick up 
scripture if the reason you're going to-scripture is just 
to distract yourself from your own-thoughts I think we also 
need to not panic because this is a problem in my-own life 
when I enter into silence if I become aware-of anxiety 
within me if I become aware of my own level of-distraction 
then I just Panic even looking at it because I don't know 
what-to do with it I'm going to be overwhelmed by it I 
don't want to sit in-silence for the next hour with this 
anxiety with these-thoughts and so so there can be a 
temptation to just just-panic I think we don't distract we 
don't panic and we don't-suppress because that's another 
Temptation I'm in my time of-prayer and I'm feeling really 
stressed out so I'm going to try to just shove-that down in 
order to be with the Lord but all that's doing is denying 
the-reality and God is in the reality so if we're-denying 
the reality we're avoiding an encounter with-him and I 
think something to remember is that we're often in life 
reacting from-places without realizing it we're um we're 
more affected by the externals-and by the things going 
through our mind than we realize just like I didn't-realize 
about the microwave fan you know I think a good example of 
this I've-probably used this before but is um our dreams I 
know we've all had the-experience where you have a dream 
maybe an anxious dream about someone like you-had an 
argument with this person and then the whole next day 
next-couple of days whenever you see this person-your 
stress levels rise and you have to remind-yourself that 
dream wasn't real I'm not in a fight with this person but 
but-clearly our subconscious does something to affect our 
our-responses so what does it look like to sit in-silence 
to not panic not distract not suppress but actually 
encounter the-reality I think it looks like sitting-down 
standing if you like to stand in prayer-kneeling and as you 
enter in and acknowledge the presence of-God after 
acknowledging his presence you can then ask 
what's-happening inside of me right now are there-places 
that are unsettled am I struggling to be-here and maybe you 
realize yeah I'm I'm feeling-unsettled and then you take 
the next step of what is it exactly that's-unsettling me 
where is this feeling coming-from I wasn't unsettled this 
morning so why am I unsettled-now well at some point that 
shift-happened and maybe I realized that it happened after 
I heard a comment that-someone made in the kitchen but the 
comment wasn't unkind-it was seemingly innocuous so what 
was it about that-comment that unsettled me why has that 
been in the back of my-mind why has that been in my 
subconscious and maybe I felt really-unloved unknown unseen 
by the comment maybe it was a critical comment-about a book 
that I happen to really love so let's say I feel unseen 
or-unknown the Temptation now is to immediately 
spiritualize-that to say but Jesus was unknown Jesus 
was-unseen and so this is good thank you Lord for this 
opportunity to be unseen-so that I can know what you 
experienced that's a good thing right-like it's good to see 
the spiritual realities that are-happening but we don't 
want to just skip right to there we don't want to just-jump 
over our Humanity I think we first say Lord that-hurt it 
doesn't feel good to be unseen and unknown-help me to unite 
that pain with yours help me to love the person who-said 
that help me to know that I'm seen and-loved and known by 
you and now-instead of just pretending like everything's 
fine instead of ignoring-Whatever anxiety is happening 
inside of us we've allowed it to be a place of-encounter 
and now maybe in this silence nothing is-unsettled maybe 
you're feeling really at peace and that's-great but the 
point that I want to make here-is that being at peace in 
your prayer being comfortable in the-silence versus having 
to confront anxiety in your-silence having to work through 
with the Lord the things that are happening in-your heart 
one of those situations is not-better than another and if 
you're using that to judge your-prayer this prayer was good 
this prayer was not-good then you're missing something 
because why do we-pray if you ask someone why they pray or 
if you ask yourself why do you pray why-do you spend time 
with the Lord I think some common answers might-be because 
it brings me peace because it's a good start to my-day 
because it helps me to respond better to people throughout 
the-day it helps me to be more virtuous throughout the-day 
it grounds me and these are all really good things-these 
are all beautiful benefits and fruits of-prayer but they 
aren't the reason we pray they aren't the reason we 
enter-into silence because the primary reason the-only 
reason ultimately that we-pray is to be in relationship now 
to be in relationship-with the Lord leads to-peace it leads 
to feeling grounded it leads to being more-virtuous it 
leads to responding better throughout the day those are all 
good-fruits but they aren't the reason we pray they're the 
consequence the-byproduct of the relationship they aren't 
the goal the goal is-Union and I think we get this 
backwards all of the time-one of my favorite quotes is is 
St seraphim of sarov he-says acquire interior peace and a 
thousand Souls around you will be-saved I usually share 
that quote with with people when they ask me how can-they 
be of the most help to their loved ones I have a child 
who's left the-church I have a friend who's struggling with 
this-situation I have have a coworker who um is going 
through this that or the-other how do I help them well the 
most important thing is is-to acquire interior peace 
yourself and that will affect the people-around you but 
even this we get backwards-because we can then try to 
acquire interior peace for the sake of helping-those around 
us but actually we need to acquire interior-peace for our 
own sake for our relationship with the-Lord and again that 
spills over into the people around us because like I said 
in-the last episode when God works good for one person he's 
using that for the good-of others it's not well I'll give 
this-person this good at the neglect of this other person 
but then at another point-I'll give the other person some 
good at the neglect of like that's not how it-works what 
God does is good for all who are-involved now can we go to 
God asking for these-things of course these are good things 
to ask for right it's good to ask him-for peace it's good 
to ask him to help us respond better throughout the-day you 
know a lot of us have I'm sure had the experience of a 
relationship in-which this person just really grounds us 
and if I'm if I'm having a really-hard day if I call them 
if I hear their voice if I see their-face then I'm able to 
come back to the present to come back to who I-am to feel 
my feet on the ground and to breathe more easily-and this 
is a good thing and it's good to call that friend and to 
have that-friend but the fact that that friend grounds-you 
is not the point of the Friendship the point of the 
Friendship-is not just what you get from them or 
it's-utilitarian and similarly the point of relationship 
with-the Lord is relationship with the-Lord and what comes 
of that is the good byproducts the good consequences 
the-overflowing of Grace because why does why does God 
want-us to not sin does he just have these arbitrary rules 
of things that he-doesn't particularly like is it like God 
is woozy at the sight of blood so he-tells us to not kill 
each other God is bored by gossip so he tells-us to not do 
it this isn't the point of not sinning-the point of not 
sinning is not just because there's this list of-things 
that God doesn't like so I won't do-them the reason he 
gives us a conscience the reason-he um through the guidance 
of of the fathers and and the authorities in the-church 
gives us quote unquote rules to follow are because he-knows 
that these particular things when we do-them there's damage 
to our relationship with-him so he wants us to not do them 
not because he doesn't like the things in-and of themselves 
but because he knows that they're going to damage 
our-relationship with him and he wants the relationship and 
we need the silence to-have that we absolutely encounter 
God in the-people around us we encounter God in our work we 
encounter God in the lurgical-prayer but we also need time 
with just Him and-us as any couple needs as any 
friends-need we need the silence to to step away from the 
worldly-cares to surrender those cares to him and to just 
be in-relationship in the name of the father of the son of 
the holy spirit-amen heavenly father thank you for the gift 
of this-day thank you for the moments of Silence that 
you've given us in it so-far and I thank you in advance for 
the moments of Silence-you'll offer Us in the day to come 
help us to embrace that-silence to enter more fully into 
relationship with you and your son and-your spirit help us 
to-not distract or numb out when we come to-silence 
whatever anxieties we're feeling whatever cares are 
distracting-us from being present to you give us the grace 
to not suppress-those things but to surrender them to you 
help us to receive whatever fruits-of prayer that you 
desire to give but to receive them as-gift as natural 
consequence and not as the goal of-prayer itself I thank 
you for these things and ask you-for these things through 
the intercession of St Nathaniel St Thomas-aquinus St sarim 
of sarov blessed Pier-Georgio St narius the most holy 
theotokos and all-the saints and through the prayers of our 
holy-fathers oh Lord Jesus Christ Our God have mercy on us 
amen
