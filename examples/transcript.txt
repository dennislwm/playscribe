you could make a case that most of the benefits in um 
lifespan uh roughly I-would say 3/4 of the benefits you can 
get towards a longer life come solely-from pursuing Better 
Health I want to say that again because-I think it is I I 
for me at least it's such a profound statement if you 
never-thought once about trying to live a longer life-and 
focused relentlessly on how can I improve my strength my 
endurance my-stamina my you know and again all the Nuance 
around these things my balance my-coordination my 
processing speed uh my working memory my emotional health 
my-happiness my relationship if you if you only focused on 
those things and never-once thought about heart disease 
cancer Alzheimer's disease specifically I still-believe you 
would capture 3/4 of the way towards optimizing 
your-lifespan hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm 
your host Peter-[Music] AA Peter welcome to a special 
episode-how you doing great awesome well for today's 
episode-we're going to do something a little different um 
one thing we know and we-can hear from people is if you 
look at podcast some sometimes podcasts aren't-the best way 
to learn about information and part of that is because each 
week we-cover a different topic in different detail and it 
maybe cancer one week-exercise the next week Alzheimer's 
whatever it may be and we go into-different levels of 
detail and so we also know we have newer people who 
are-listening and sometimes they can be a little 
overwhelmed by all the different-things and so what we 
wanted to do was record an episode which is 
basically-longevity 101 and so we're just going to go 
through core lifespan Health span-each of the tactics and 
just touch on the core Frameworks to give people kind-of a 
foundation of how they can think about their own longevity 
and also how-they can think about when they listen to the 
podcast how these different pieces-fit together and so if 
you've listened since episode one you might not need 
to-listen to this one but it might be one you share with 
someone to be like hey-this is what this guy talks about so 
we're going to hit all the five tactics-some real basic 
questions but it should be pretty simple pretty high level 
so-with that said anything you want to add before we get 
into it I mean simple and-high level aren't typically words 
I associate with very well so I'm a little-uh I'm a little 
gunshy31 [Music]-today for lunch and why should everyone 
eat that for lunch every day as well-absolutely that would 
be a great question perfect think I've already-forgotten 
what I no no I remember what I had I remember what I had 
all right-we'll save that for the nutrition section but um 
starting off with just a-few foundational level questions 
the first being how do you even define this-word longevity 
it's a word that get thrown around a lot means 
different-things to different people I think it'd be nice 
just to be like for this-conversation to Anchor what we're 
talking about how do you define-longevity yeah I I don't um 
I don't make an argument that my definition is the-best 
definition uh but I agree with the idea that whenever 
someone is talking-about it um it's worth asking them what 
they mean by it and it's also why I tend-to bristle at the 
um the association with longevity because you know 
if-someone says oh do you you know are you a longevity 
doctor or something like-that I have no idea if they know 
what longevity means according to my-definition which again 
is not to say it's the right definition but it's the-lens 
through which I think about it and therefore everything I 
talk about any-question I answer will be through the lens 
so um so the way I think about it-and I suspect the way 
some others do as well is that uh-longevity is well it's a 
function uh I think so-again I tend to think of things 
mathematically made up of two vectors-and one of these 
vectors is lifespan and one of these vectors is Health span 
and-both of these vectors are necessary to you know 
demonstrate the function of-longevity now one of these 
vectors is much easier to understand because it is-um it is 
discret it is binary um and it is objective and that is the 
lifespan-Vector so there are some Edge cases but for the 
most part you are alive or you-are dead and we think of 
that through the lens of death certificate death um-again 
we could talk about an edge case you can have an individual 
who is brain-dead but who is being kept alive um and and we 
could debate whether that person-is dead or alive but I 
think for most people there's very little confusion-about 
what it means to be alive or dead and notice that lifespans 
says nothing-about the quality of a person's life we'll 
save that for a second um but in a-nutshell that is 
lifespan it is to be to be respiring or not to be respiring 
um-and it is again one of the vectors of of longevity so um 
in as much as we want to-increase longevity we presumably 
want to have something to do with increasing-lifespan the 
second Vector that makes up this uh longevity function is 
the Health-span Vector this is far more complicated to 
explain um it is far more-subjective uh it is analog as 
opposed to digital meaning it is not sort of-discret onof 
it is you know variable and um it also has three-components 
in the way that I think about it so one of those is a 
physical-component one of them is a cognitive component-and 
one of those is an emotional component now in the first 
version of-outlive when I wrote it or maybe it was the 
second version but not the version-that got published I I 
went to Great Lengths to-describe that the 
cardiorespiratory death the the sort of you know I'm 
not-respiring death certificate death as type one death and 
then I went into-great machinations to talk about the three 
types of decline in health span as-physical cognitive and 
emotional death and I think for probably good 
reason-everybody uh the publisher and and Bill everybody 
really pushed back on that and-they thought it was a little 
too morbid to talk about physical death as you know-the the 
the death of your exoskeleton and cognitive decline and I 
think they-were right I think that death was probably too 
strong a word there but my-point was that um all of those 
things can be robbed of a person and even-though they're 
still technically alive their quality of life has been 
sapped so-let's not think of it that way let's think of it 
as you have these three sub-vectors of the vector Health 
span and um each of those has you know there are-ways that 
we can we can try to quantify them um and um but ultimately 
I think-people will have their own subjective assessment of 
what it means to be-physically healthy or what it means to 
be cognitively healthy or what it means-to be emotionally 
healthy um I think another thing that's worth pointing 
out-here is that two of those three inevitably decline with 
age so the-physical component of Health span which I'll 
Define in some detail in a moment-and the cognitive 
component of Health span they they very predictably 
decline-with age now that doesn't mean that everybody's 
decline at the same rate and-that doesn't mean that for 
everybody the decline reaches a level that is quote-unquote 
pathological but it simply means and I-was thinking about 
this today in the gym actually I was like wow it is really 
so-obvious to me with each passing day that I am completely 
past my Prime physically-and cognitively I mean I am and I 
and I've also accepted the fact like I will-never again be 
as physically strong fit flexible free of-pain like pick 
your metrics that all make up physical uh Health span I 
will-never again reach the Pinnacles that I had reached in 
my late teens and 20s and-similarly you know cognitively um 
you know I'm I'm-basically a [ __ ] compared to the 
person I used to be uh in terms of processing-speed problem 
solving just raw intellectual horsepower um and and and-you 
know those things are going to decline even further um now 
there is-more Nuance to this um because there are certain 
things physically today that I-think I actually do better 
than I did before in other words I've you know you-you you 
you take advantage of the fact that as you're getting you 
know less-explosive less powerful well you can still kind 
of maintain strength um and-if you learn to move more 
intelligently you can actually become more effective-and 
similarly as our intelligence transitions from a more fluid 
form when-we're young to a more crystallized experiential 
form when we're older um we-we you know we still have 
remarkable ability to contribute but there's no-denying 
that on some of the Prime levers against which you would 
evaluate these-we're in a state of decline conversely the 
third part of uh Health span which-is emotional health it 
actually doesn't really tie to age much at all uh-depending 
on how you evaluate it it almost seems to have a U-shaped 
curve um-not a you know really big obvious U but kind of a 
dip in in in I think-statistically probably the late 40s um 
and then a gradual Rising again so one-of the things that I 
always try to remind myself and and and then remind 
my-patients is this is something we can really look forward 
to provided we do-the work right is that you know I can be 
emotionally better off in a decade than-I am today and I am 
certainly better off today than I was a decade ago so um 
I-would say that that is at the highest level how I 
describe longevity and-therefore when a patient comes to me 
and says um you know I'm interested in-longevity I want to 
make sure that what they're interested in is what 
I-understand because there are many other definitions of 
longevity out there and-if your definition of longevity is 
I want to live to be-200 um I I wouldn't obviously be able 
to help you um so the way I think about it-is longevity 
means how do we live longer and I I think that means you 
know years-longer a decade longer it doesn't mean a 
doubling of lifespan and how do we-prevent the um sort of 
well I think a better way to describe it is how do 
we-reduce the rate of decline of Health span that that 
would probably be uh kind-of the most the most operative 
way to talk about it so that's obviously very-verbose and 
that's why I think it's not something that you know you 
explain very-quickly to somebody um but given that that's 
the purpose of what we're talking-about today I think it's 
it's probably worth going into that-detail and to double 
click on that because you kind of at the end 
there-mentioned where I feel like a lot of times when 
longevity and that word gets-thrown around it is on the how 
long you live side-um so I think it's worth double clicking 
why do you think it's so important for-someone to not only 
care about how long they live the lifespan side but also 
the-healthspan side that you said there and also how well 
they-live there are several reasons for this to be-relevant 
um you know first you can think of this kind of at the 
level of just a-thought experiment right so in the in the 
in the book I write about the Greek-god tonus and how he 
wished for-immortality um he was of course granted his wish 
but because he had forgot to-ask for uh Eternal youth he 
became you know this uh you know in indefinitely-suffering 
human being who continued to age in perpetuity while his 
body-declined so I I think just sort of theoretically I 
think anybody who thinks-about it for long enough would 
realize that any desire to live longer has to 
be-accompanied by a desire to preserve Health span so I 
believe that anybody-who thinks they want to live to be 200 
implicit within that I hope is the-desire to function as 
someone who is much younger right if I if if if if a-person 
says to me I want to live to be 95 well I'm assuming and if 
not we'll-tease this out I'm assuming they don't want to 
look like most 95 year olds-right what I assume is I want 
to live to be 95 but I would hope that in the final-years 
of my life I function like a 75y old right a healthy 75y 
old so so so so-that's why I think the second thing here is 
and the reason at least for me that-Health span is such an 
important focus and we're going to talk I'm sure 
about-medicine 2.0 versus medicine 3.0 but one of the 
most-important concept ceps within medicine 3.0 is an equal 
obsession with health-span as lifespan and again Health 
span by itself is valuable at any given age-whether it's 40 
50 70 or 80 to for your age have better physical-uh a 
better physical body a better cognitive mind better 
emotional health-always exceeds being below it it's so self 
self-evident it doesn't require-stating it secondly all the 
things that you do to improve your health span are-twers 
and anybody who works for me knows what a twer is and a 
three-fer and a-fourer and how much I hate one fers so a 
two fur means you're getting a two for-the price of one so 
when you do all those things to improve your health 
span-you are also improving your lifespan you could make a 
case that most of the-benefits in um lifespan uh roughly I 
would say 3/4 of the benefits you can-get towards a longer 
life come solely from pursuing Better-Health I want to say 
that again because I think it is I I for me at least 
it's-such a profound statement if you never thought once 
about trying to live a-longer life and focused relentlessly 
on how can I improve my strength my-endurance my stamina my 
you know and again all the Nuance around these things-my 
balance my coordination my processing speed uh my working 
memory my emotional-health my happiness my relationship if 
you if you only focused on those things-and never once 
thought about heart disease cancer Alzheimer's 
disease-specifically I still believe you would 
capture-three4 of the way towards optimizing your lifespan 
again I think it's a bold-statement I can't confirm that 
that's exactly correct right I mean that's not-that's not a 
studi question but my conviction is quite strong that 
Health-span pursuit of Health span is valuable in its own 
right even if it didn't-lengthen life at all and the fact 
is it probably does and it probably does to a-greater 
effect than all of the efforts that largely medicine 2.0 
puts directly-into lifespan extension and you hinted at it 
there and so I think it's worth-just kind of going into it 
you've written about it too but do you want to-talk real 
quick about medicine 1.0 2.0 3.0 so medicine 1.0 is the 
type of-medicine that dominated for virtually all of human 
existence so if we you know-if we argue that humans have 
been around you know Homo sapiens have been around-about 
250,000 years from from the arrival of our species until 
the latter-part of the 19th century um we were practicing 
this thing called medicine-1.0 which truthfully wasn't 
medicine in the way that we think about it today it-wasn't 
scientific in the way that we understand science today it 
was the best-that humans could do missing this tool right 
missing this tool of inference and-you know it relied on a 
belief about you know perhaps Gods Spirits-humors um and so 
you know it to be just blunt was largely-ineffective um and 
so you know the the doctor of the past didn't have any 
tools-in large part because they didn't have any 
understanding of what was going on-in terms of disease 
processes so not surprisingly humans uh didn't live 
that-long on average uh and you know the median life 
expectancy would have been-into the late 30s or early 40s 
um the causes of death were typically related-to 
communicable diseases uh infections and death Associated um 
with-child mortality and um maternal mortality so just the 
process of having-a baby was incredibly dangerous to both 
the mother and the baby um and obviously-that heavily skews 
lifespan data if you're killing young mothers and babies-in 
the process of having babies you're really bringing down 
lifespan and life-expectancy and couple that with 
infections communicable diseases and-Trauma um and you know 
I think most people aren't surprised to know that 
yep-that's pretty much how people died um and then of 
course after the after you-know the Civil War and we we 
move into the latter part of the 19th century a-couple of 
things start to come together now the first of these 
actually happened-in the 17th century um but it wouldn't 
become German remain to Medicine until-300 years later um 
or 200 years later rather and that was Francis 
Bacon-codifying the scientific method so again this is 
something you know we take for-granted today but this idea 
that you would make an observation which is what-science is 
All About You observe something around you you 
observe-something in the natural world you form a 
hypothesis about why it is happening-you design an 
experiment that is equipped to test the-hypothesis you 
conduct the experiment and measure the outcome and you 
compare-the results of the experiment to the prediction of 
the hypothesis and that is-effectively the framework for 
what science is and so with that as the-scaffolding upon 
which people could begin to make inference you now layer 
on-on some other remarkable discoveries and insights so a 
creation of the light-microscope the Advent of germ Theory 
and ultimately the development of-antimicrobial agents all 
of these things collectively I think I would add to 
that-just the practice of Sanitation led to a remarkable 
change in-the trajectory of human lifespan um and of course 
it's so-remarkable that if you go from the late 1800 unds 
until you know fast forward-just 100 years which again is a 
sliver of time across a 250,000 year timeline-human 
lifespan approximately doubled um so you know again three 
four five-generations to double human lifespan that had 
previously been unchanged for-hundreds of Generations is a 
remarkable feat and we call this new system of-medicine 
medicine 2.0 now there's lots of more Nuance to-get into 
medicine 2.0 uh medicine 2.0 ultimately developed even 
more-remarkable statistical tools that allowed for things 
called randomized-controlled experiments or rcts randomized 
control trials and this-really allowed medicine 2.0 to 
flourish and become-supercharged and um obviously for the 
most part medicine 1.0 was completely-displaced by this now 
that doesn't mean that there aren't still some quacks 
out-there that practice witchcraft but for the most part um 
you know when a person-has an infection when a person has 
congestive heart failure when a person-is in renal failure 
when a person has appendicitis and needs to have 
their-appendix removed when a woman has a complicated 
pregnancy all of these-things now for people who are in the 
developed world are really easy things-to manage using the 
tool to Kit of medicine 2.0 so again medicine 2.0 was-and 
remains an enormous success and I certainly wouldn't be 
sitting here-talking without medicine 2.0 I would likely 
have been dead already uh as-would you have so why do we 
need to go any further why do we need a medicine-3.0 well 
for all of the successes of medicine 2.0 it has indeed had 
a couple-of obvious and notable failures um the most 
obvious is that lifespan has-largely faltered so there 
really has not been any extension of lifespan beyond-that 
which came from the eradication of the conditions that led 
to the demise of-most people uh between the Civil War and 
the end of the first world-war um in particular the types 
of diseases that kill people today uh are-very different 
types of diseases from those that killed people 150 years 
ago-so the bleading causes of death which I describe as the 
Four Horsemen of death-uh are the diseases of 
atherosclerosis so U coronary artery disease 
and-cerebrovascular disease cancer the neurodegenerative 
diseases and dementing-diseases uh so Alzheimer's disease 
Parkinson's disease Louis body dementia-vascular dementia 
frontotemporal dementia all of those diseases and and-then 
these slew of metabolic diseases that while directly not 
responsible for-an enormous number of lives lost compared 
to the other categories uh-indirectly contribute immensely 
by amplifying all of these now there's a-couple of other 
things I haven't mentioned there at the population 
level-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is also an 
enormous cause of death um but-its caus is almost 
exclusively related to cigarette smoking so I don't 
really-hold medicine 2.0 particular L responsible for the 
failure of-mitigating that that's really more of a public 
health question um if people-don't smoke they don't get 
COPD even though COPD is one of the leading causes-of death 
um there are of course accidental deaths um and we can 
spend-some time talking about those later because there's 
an enormous spread of-what those look like across lifespan 
and of course by geography-so in Ence the purpose of 
medicine 3.0 is to try to address where medicine 2.0-has 
fallen short it's not to replace medicine-2.0 um I 
certainly from time to time um hear feedback from people 
who I think-misunderstand the arguments I've tried to laid 
out and uh there there's nowhere-that I'm suggesting that 
we need to do away with medicine 2.0 that we don't-want the 
system as it exists today in its capacity to do what it 
can-do what I argue is that we need to shift resources away 
from solely focusing on-medicine 2.0 to focusing on what 
we'll talk about in a minute which is medicine-3.0 so if 
we're putting a 100 units of resources today into medicine 
2.0 I-think most economists would argue that's still too 
many units of of economic-input in other words Healthcare 
makes up far too big a section of the economy so-maybe 
instead of it being a 100 units that go into healthare it 
really ought-to be closer to 60 units that go into 
healthare and I would argue further-maybe 30 of those units 
should be aimed towards medicine 3.0 and 30 of those-units 
should be aimed towards medicine 2.0 because when it hits 
the fan and-something goes really wrong you know again 
trauma infection Heart Attack by-all means you want 
medicine 2.0 there to Back Stop Those things but medicine 
3.0-job is to make those encounters with medicine 2.0 less 
frequent less severe-and later in life so that is 
effectively the difference the the the the the final-point 
I'll make on that is kind of just briefly explaining what 
medicine 3.0 is-which is because at this point it's 
self-evident it almost doesn't need to-be explained 
medicine 3.0 really has two main Hallmarks uh the first is 
that it-is aimed at preventing rather than treating chronic 
disease by acting early-acting aggressively and tailoring 
the therapies to the individuals based on-the best 
available evidence which is not necessarily going to be 
derivable from-randomized control trials and the second 
pillar of medicine-3.0 is that Health span is to be given 
at least as much effort and attention as-lifespan this is 
again another enormous difference between medicine 2.0 
and-Medicine 3.0 medicine 2.0 does not Place emphasis on 
health span its emphasis on-health span is anywhere from 
zero to very small depending on the subs-specialty so there 
are there are certainly some Physicians whose-practices do 
take them a little bit into the arena of Health span but um 
you know-outside of for example Physicians uh or healthc 
care providers who work-specifically in the arena of mental 
health again it's relatively low-obviously orthopedic 
surgery is a is a PR a you know a discipline of 
medicine-that is more squarely uh featured in the health 
span Arena but for the most part-most of the health care 
dollars are spent on addressing uh and trying to-elongate 
lifespan um and I would argue that we need to be you know 
putting just-as much effort into Health span so that's 
that's the fundamental difference-between medicine 3.0 2.0 
and 1.0 and to double click on the four horsemen just 
a-little bit you mentioned what those four are but do you 
also want to talk a-little bit about for each of them what 
we know in terms of prevention right so-if medicine 3.0 
prevention is really important you know how do you 
think-about our knowledge of those diseases as it relates 
to someone who is trying to-live as long as possible sure 
sure so we'll take them from the top so the-atherosclerotic 
diseases um along with the fourth Horsemen which is 
the-metabolic diseases are probably the two that we have 
the most insight into um as-far as what are the 
pathophysiologic drivers and therefore we 
either-theoretically uh or in some cases practically also 
have I think the best-insight into how to prevent them so 
ascvd is a disease that has both a-genetic component and an 
environmental component but it really doesn't have-much of 
a component of luck as far as we can tell so you know 
stochastic-processes involving mutations uh doesn't seem to 
play a role right there's-there's just pure causality from 
the standpoint of environmental triggers and-from genetic 
inheritance so um both of those factors-play through three 
key Pathways all of which are important so first is 
a-lipoprotein pathway second is an endothelial pathway and 
third is an-inflammatory pathway but I realize as I'm 
saying that it doesn't make a lot of-sense so I'm going to 
try to step back and put this into English the three-things 
that have to happen for atherosclerotic disease are 
as-follows the first is a molecule called A lipoprotein 
which Carri cholesterol-through the body and specifically A 
lipoprotein that has an apob protein on-it because there 
are lipoproteins that don't have apobs on them and we 
don't-have to worry about those but the lipoproteins that 
have apobs on them can-enter the artery wall when the 
endothelium uh is intact but they do so-more prevalently 
and more easily when the endothelium is damaged 
the-endothelium is simply the lining of cells on the 
innermost membrane I mean-closest to the artery or 
outermost from the standpoint of the artery wall the-one 
that is most in contact with the circulation if those um 
apob wrapped-lipoproteins get trapped inside the 
endothelial layer a chemical process-known as oxidation 
takes place and that leads to inflammation what that means 
is-the body thinks something is wrong and I need to fight 
it just as when you get an-infection a healthy immune 
system detects the inflammation caused by the-microbial 
agent and it sends the troops there to get rid of it but in 
this case-the insult does not come from an infection it 
comes from the oxidation of-the cholesterol contained 
within the apob particle as it sits in the-endothelium and 
that process initiates a devastating Cascade of-events that 
ultimately can create so much damage in the wall of the 
artery-that it can lead to a rupture of the plaque which is 
the repairing process-the rupture of that plaque acutely 
leads to blood loss and ultimately oxygen loss-to the 
muscles of the heart beyond the point of that blockage that 
process is-known as a heart attack and about 50% of the 
time it is fatal the first time a-person has one-so if you 
want to think about preventing cardiovascular disease es 
schic-cardiovascular disease you have to have an insight 
into all of those things you-have to be thinking about how 
do I have fewer apob particles because the more of-those 
particles you have the more of them that are going to end 
enter the-endothelial space the data on this is uh as 
unambiguous as any data are in-medicine from clinical 
trials epidemiologic trials and mandelian-randomization in 
other words you have the only three layers of evidence 
you-can ever look to experimental data Mr and clinical EPI 
and they all say the-same thing there is a log linear 
reduction in-ascvd as apob goes down the second thing you 
have to do is you have to protect-your endothelium so 
anything that aggravates and weakens and makes 
the-endothelium more vulnerable to penetration by apob is 
problematic and-the most common factors that we think are 
doing that are smoking blood-pressure and very likely the 
metabolic conditions that cluster with insulin-resistance 
hyperinsulinemia um and uh type 2-diabetes so some 
combination of elevated glucose elevated insulin and 
other-metabolic byproducts such as homocystine uric acid 
all of these things serve to-weaken the endothelium along 
with elevated blood pressure and smoking and-that creates a 
greater susceptability again it's not surprising that all 
of-those things pose about an equal risk to card 
cardiovascular disease as does the-presence of elevated 
apob and then the third piece of the-puzzle and the one for 
which we really don't do much directly in the way 
of-treatment is the higher the inflammation the more likely 
uh the higher this is-going to be and the reason this is 
probably lesser of the three is with-very rare exceptions 
is it a direct therapeutic tool in other words we-clearly 
therapeutically address the first two-right we 
therapeutically lower apob we manage blood pressure we tell 
people to-not smoking you know tell people to not smoke 
which of course is a therapy we-you know use exercise and 
nutrition to manage metabolic health and even-pharmacology 
but directly from a pharmacologic standpoint we don't 
really-manage inflammation we can there are a couple of 
agents that are used somewhat-not impressively uh and maybe 
somewhat on the margins impressively but most of-the 
evidence around reducing inflammation probably comes from 
doing-things much more broadly around nutrition sleep uh 
and exercise that-we've talked about elsewhere so in a 
nutshell that's really what it comes-down to and it's for 
that reason that I'm often making a very bold 
statement-which is even though cardiovascular disease is 
the leading cause of death um-in Men in women in the United 
States but also in the world um it doesn't need to-be it 
really really really doesn't need to be and it is a very 
bizarre tragedy-that you know 19 million people a year 
still die from cardiovascular disease um-given how much we 
know about what causes it and how many tools we have to 
prevent-it so that's the first you kind of mentioned the 
first second Horseman-there how do you think about 
prevention for the others which is neurogenerative-diseases 
and Cancers yeah so let's take them in order so cancer 
would be the-next most uh uh deadly of the of the horsemen 
and here is one where a lot of-what I said with respect to 
um heart disease is is actually quite different-you know in 
heart disease we we really have a pretty clear sense of 
what the-genetics look like so there are a handful of 
genetic things like familial-hyper cholesterolemia which is 
a very very heterogeneous condition that raises-APO 
lipoprotein uh B uh LP little a which we save for 
another-time we've got lots of content on that um but when 
it comes to cancer we we-know that boy there are some 
really clear and obvious genetic drivers of-cancer like 
there are a handful of genes some that many people have 
heard of such-as braa 1 or braa 2 which are heavily 
associated with um breast-cancer um or Lynch syndrome um 
which would be heavily associated with colon-cancer and 
other types of cancer but for the most part when we say 
that cancer-runs in a person's family we still aren't 
really even able to identify the-genes through which this 
is transmitted it appears to be very-polygenic furthermore 
while we know of at least two significant 
environmental-triggers for cancer smoking and obesity and 
I'll say more about obesity in a-second um we actually have 
very little to say about many other triggers despite-what 
people would have you believe um we have very little 
insight about if at all-foods you know specific Foods at 
isocaloric amount so we can talk about-an abundance of food 
because that factors into the Obesity trigger but if-we're 
talking about a bunch of people eating an isocaloric energy 
balanced-diet again despite all of the propaganda around 
this oh red meat this or soy that-or whatever there's 
actually just the scantest of evidence to suggest that 
any-of these are promoting cancer in the slightest way so 
um when you take all of-this together what you realize is 
that okay smoking is clearly driving cancer-obesity is 
clearly driving cancer not all cancers but many cancers 
about-2third of cancers have a very strong tie to obesity I 
think if you look under the-hood of that you'll realize 
it's probably not the excess fat per se or-the osity that's 
driving cancer and rather it's the growth factors that 
are-doing it so obesity comes with more inflammation comes 
with more growth-factors such as insulin and igf and it 
seems more likely that those are the-things that are 
actually leading the increase uh in cancer-but that leaves 
a bit of a vacancy in terms of what else explains it and 
this-is where um you know a scientist like berd vogelstein 
and others would suggest-that look there's actually just a 
component of really bad luck here um you-know there are 
mutations that occur every Cancer begins with a mutation 
and-most of those are somatic mutations that means that 
most of those are mutations-that occur in cells that were 
developed normally right so these are your your-germ line 
the cells you inherited these were normal cells but then 
mutations-were Acquired and mutations fall into one of two 
categories these are either-mutations that are tumor 
promoting so oncogenic mutations or they are-mutations of 
tumor suppression so we have genes that are set out to 
suppress-cancer and if you get a mutation in one of 
those-the body loses the ability to suppress cancer and 
then we get mutations in-genes that turn cancer on and 
again a number of these are inherited but many-of them most 
of them are acquired and the what is vexing us still and 
again I-think the best working hypothesis is that um a bad 
luck plays a lot of role-in that now you know it would be a 
topic for an entirely different podcast to-look at other 
things that may be triggering those mutations again in 
some-cases we know that viruses play a role in those 
mutations but where what I'm-really talking about is where 
do the majority of these come from and and-anyway that 
that's an area of of huge interest-um and um the other 
problem with cancer that also is not afforded 
to-cardiovascular disease is the treatment options are 
fewer um or I shouldn't say-are fewer I would say are less 
effective so um a person today who has 
advanced-cardiovascular disease has a much better prognosis 
much better prognosis than a-person today who has very 
Advanced cancer uh a person today with stage four-I.E 
metastatic uh endothelial tumors so that means a solid 
organ tumor like-breast lung pancreas Prost at colon one of 
the sort of quote unquote bread and-butter tumors a person 
today who has one of those cancers that has spread from-its 
original site to a distant site that's metastatic or stage 
four cancer-that person has about the same 10year survival 
as a person did with that tumor-50 years ago they have a 
much longer median survival they will live longer-they 
might live for five years instead of one year and that's 
nothing to to to-sneeze at um but they're not cured at any 
higher a rate um and and obviously-that's a discouraging 
statistic um so that's um you know as we think about-cancer 
we we obviously think the first and most important thing is 
to do-everything you can to avoid getting it but as I 
alluded to that Playbook is not-as thick as the don't get 
heart disease Playbook um and that leads to a 
very-controversial thing that I talk about which is is the 
importance of early and-aggressive screening um and again 
we don't have to go into that now we've-already devoted 
tons of content to the arguments for and against that 
approach-but hopefully this explains why um that is that is 
still a position I-hold and so looking at the last of the 
horsemen neurodegenerative disease such-as Alzheimer's um 
something we get asked a lot about a lot how does that look 
in-term terms of what you kind of discussed on cancer 
cardiovascular disease as it-relates to prevention well I 
would say it's a little bit in the middle um in-other words 
I think we actually have a slightly better sense of some of 
the-causes uh not not in all cases um but certainly with 
Alzheimer's disease we're-getting a much better sense of 
which people are susceptible what genes play a-role from a 
genetic susceptibility stand point and genes do play a 
pretty big-role there uh and we also understand the other 
factors and part of the reason for-this Nick is there's a 
very simple but surprisingly accurate adage which 
states-what's good for the heart is good for the brain and 
study after study after-study have demonstrated the 
following every intervention that we-take to lower the risk 
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-also reduces the 
risk of dementia and that means Alzheimer's disease 
vascular-dementia uh which are the two main ones but also 
other forms of dementia so that-means having better 
metabolic Health having lower apob having lower 
blood-pressure not smoking those things dramatically reduce 
your risk of-cardiovascular disease and they dramatically 
reduce your risk of-Alzheimer's disease now in area where 
dementia has an even bigger positive-impact in intervention 
than cardiovascular disease is with that of-exercise so 
it's no surprise that exercise improves a person's odds of 
not-getting Andor surviving cardiovascular disease cancer 
dementia but I would say-that the evidence for the benefits 
of exercise are both greater in magnitude-and greater in um 
confidence when it comes to the prevention 
of-neurodegenerative disease so um you know it's it's 
interesting because I do think-that many people fear 
dementia more than any other condition um and they're 
a-very obvious reasons why that would be the case um and it 
might be that in our-practice we're a bit more optimistic 
than most based on just the nature of-what we do and um the 
you know the types of people that-are in our practice 
meaning like you know people who really study prevention-um 
and and really look at kind of these early early signs of 
dementia and-looking you know and look at how you know 
specific interventions can make a-difference um but 
unfortunately um the flip side of that-is that of all the 
chronic diseases um the the dementing and-neurodegenerative 
diseases are the ones for which we have at this time 
virtually-no viable therapeutic options so the real name of 
the game with uh neurod-degenerative diseases but 
specifically the dementing diseases and the only-other one 
I'll really mention here briefly is Parkinson's Disease 
uh-because it's the most prevalent movement disorder is 
that avoiding them is the-first second and third priority 
on a list of three priorities um once we get-into treatment 
land um at least at this point in time it's not 
very-promising um so these are both diseases where having 
as higher Reserve as you-can make a big difference so the 
higher your cognitive reserve and the higher-your movement 
reserve the more resilient you are to the effects of 
these-conditions I think I should just State at the 
conclusion here that you know we-we we shouldn't ignore the 
fourth Horsemen which is of course the the-spectrum of 
metabolic diseases as I said kind of at the outset I mean I 
I think-along with cardiovascular disease we really have a 
pretty clear sense um-mechanistically of what's driving 
this I mean this appears to be primarily a-consequence of 
overnutrition um so energy imbalance is-really the driving 
factor of insulin resistance and insulin resistance 
is-really the driving factor of the downstream effects that 
ultimately lead-to everything from fatty liver disease type 
2 diabetes and again these diseases-in their own right are 
are quite harmful and devastating um but their their 
real-uh danger of them is the effect that they're having on 
the other three-Horsemen where they're increasing your risk 
by you know 25 to 50% so they-really are gasoline on the 
fire of the other-diseases and the last kind of 
foundational question before we get into-tactics would be 
we just talked so much about prevention and the importance 
of-it which if anyone who is younger listening hopefully 
encourages them to-kind of play that longer game but what 
about someone who's older so they just-heard you talk about 
prevention the importance of it and they might be-thinking 
elves you know I wonder if it's too late for me to start 
thinking about-my longevity what would you say to that well 
I mean I think there's like the-theoretical answer and the 
Practical answer right I mean I think the-theoretical 
answer is look well you still have you know breath in your 
lungs-it's not too late to do something but I also think-um 
that we're all in a car driving towards the edge of a cliff 
and it's a-lot easier to slow the car down and make sure 
that you either avoid the cliff Al-together or at a minimum 
you know slow your route to the Cliff's Edge-dramatically 
if you begin the slowing process before you get there in 
other-words everybody understands that when you see a red 
light you have to be-applying the brakes before you reach 
the actual light so at some point I think it-is very 
difficult to um to to back out of a situation but I also 
think that-that's the rare exception and not the rule so uh 
you know I I've even in the-book written about uh 
individuals who are in their 70s before they take 
their-first committed step towards health and these are 
individuals that in their 80s-now are doing better than 
they were in their 60s from a health perspective from-a 
movement perspective so um I would absolutely hope that a 
person listening-to us in what might be thought of as their 
Twilight years who's thinking man-I wish I did something 
about this sooner is it too late I would say it's not 
too-late um you'll have to make concessions you need to 
start slower you need to-make sure you're not getting 
injured I mean there's an entire Playbook and we-actually 
have a podcast around this episode uh this topic 
specifically-around you know what what would what would an 
exercise program for the-elderly look like um but you know 
I definitely would be um very disappointed-that if if 
anyone thought I was communicating that uh once you reach 
a-certain age it's sort of all bets are off and you know so 
moving from-healthspan lifespan to now the tactics um I 
think we'll go through each of them-but I think it'd be 
helpful at the outset if you just kind of list what 
the-five tactics in your quote unquote longevity toolkit 
are yeah I just kind-of list things into buckets right and 
this is not I wouldn't say this is-collectively exhaustive 
um there are other things that I think matter that-don't 
warrant a bucket in my in my view or maybe I should come up 
with a sixth-bucket that I would put every other thing into 
and we could talk about that-as well but the big five 
buckets are nutrition exercise-sleep pharmacology and 
emotional-health and again we could talk about a sixth 
bucket which would be-pollution uh temperature you know 
radical temperature-exposure um accident avoidance right so 
behaviors to invoid you know harmful-accidents Automotive 
accidents things like that so so there's like 
there's-definitely also like a grab bags sixth you know 
column that you could include-if you wanted to but when I 
but I mostly talk about the the first five and we'll-start 
with your favorite which is not ironic in that statement it 
is actually-your favorite which is exercise and so I think 
what would be helpful is you've-talked about this before 
but this kind of framework of the centinary de cathlon-do 
you want to just quickly State what that is because I think 
it kind of gives-some grounding and Foundation to how you 
think about exercise compared to how-others may talk about 
it yeah so there's so much I could say about this I 
really-thought you were going to throw me uh the usual ball 
and start with nutrition-which of course is not my favorite 
but we will talk about it um but you're-right exercise is 
my favorite and it is my favorite um because I think the 
data-are very clear that exercise if leveraged to its 
capacity-has a greater impact on your lifespan that's 
remember that's the how long you-live peace and your health 
span that's the how well you live peace than any of-the 
others with the only exception potentially being emotional 
health right-so there you know there's clearly going to be 
the case of the individual whose-emotional health is in 
such ruins that until that is addressed no amount 
of-physical health matters and in fact any anything else is 
just prolongation-of Agony but if if you exclude that case 
which is I don't want to minimize that-case because I think 
there are many people who um have been in that-situation um 
exercise really is the is the king of of-interventions so 
you alluded to something that is one of my favorite 
um-topics which is called the centenarian decathlon so uh 
and again I I realize-that some people have read the book 
and they understand what this means or-they've heard me 
talk about it but again the purpose of this podcast I think 
is-to make sure that someone who's new um maybe maybe gets 
up to speed on this or-it's a refresher for someone so um 
the centinary in De-cathlon is an idea that came to me in 
the summer of-2018 um and it's uh it's an idea that 
occurred in an instant but it was really-the result of many 
years uh probably four years of suffering-uh so to speak so 
the the suffering started in at the end of-2014 when I 
decided to stop competitively-cycling and not only did I 
stop cycling but I was not going to go back to any-other 
sport so I was not going to be competing anymore in 
Master's swimming-cycling obviously had no desire to go 
back and compete in boxing or martial-arts or anything like 
that basically I was I was done competing-and all I wanted 
to do was exercise for the sake of exercise and this for me 
at-least was a bizarre foreign idea because from the age of 
13 until that point in-time which was 41 or 42 I had never 
trained without a-specific purpose every single rep every 
single lap every single pedal stroke-everything I ever did 
was always geared towards a purpose and um now for 
the-first time ever I was kind of like huh what should I do 
today I guess I should-go for a run okay I guess I'll lift 
weights tomorrow I'm in the gym lifting-what am I Lifting 
for well I used to do this I guess I should still do this 
you-know but it was like this totally rudderless existence 
that I had and it-stayed that way until the summer of 2018 
when I was at the funeral of the parent-of one of my best 
friends and and um again I I apologies for repeating 
this-because I do write about this in the book but 
basically at that funeral I-realized that while my friend's 
uh mom had died at a relatively old age I think-about 89-um 
her physical life had basically demised so significantly 
in-the past decade that her actual death was almost just a 
matter of uh formality-but she had lost the ability to do 
the things that mattered to her most a-decade earlier so 
she couldn't play golf anymore because of her-shoulder she 
couldn't Garden because of her knees and hips and back I 
mean she-just couldn't she couldn't even play with 
her-grandkids um and so she spent most of the last decade 
of her life largely-uninvolved in anything and um you know 
did come down with-dementia in the final year of her life 
and that's what ultimately took her life-but um you know uh 
I I was just totally-blown away by this person that I once 
remembered as being completely vibrant-losing everything 
and spending this last year uh in this state and I realized 
in-that moment as I literally sat in a church pew first of 
all this is really-common and and and second ly this is 
what I want to train for like I for the-first time in four 
years realized aha the thing I want to train for is 
to-avoid this I want to come up with an event an athletic 
event that will be-done at the end of my life and 
everything between now and then will be-training for it and 
so I just came up with this idea called the centenarian 
to-cathlon not because it implies that one has to live to a 
100 to compete or not-even to imply that it has to have 10 
events but simply as a mental model to-say what are the 
most important activities both activities of daily-living 
and activities of performance that I want to be able to do 
at the end-of my life and how well can I define them how 
well can I understand the-physical traits that will be 
necessary to execute-them and then how much can I reverse 
from there or backcast from there what I-need to be doing 
today to increase the probability of doing those 
things-tomorrow to the highest level and that has become 
obviously a huge Obsession of-mine as you know uh I along 
with a a couple of other folks have started a-company 
around this called 10 squared which is just geared towards 
training-people to do this um and I think that it is at 
least until someone shows me a-better idea the best model 
for How to Train if your goal is not something 
very-specific so again if you came to me and said you know 
I know how much you love-Jiu-Jitsu if you're like look I 
there's this tournament coming up in six months-and I 
really want to compete for it that's not the centenarian to 
cathlon-that's a very specific type of training you need to 
be doing in Jiu-Jitsu to go-and compete there if you know 
my wife uh is running the Boston Marathon next year-and she 
wants to you know run a certain time she will have nothing 
to do with-training her centinary into cathlon she is going 
to be doing very very specific-running workouts to make 
sure she hits her goals so there are lots of other-ways to 
train but my point is that most people aren't training to 
be the best at-their local jiu-jitsu tournament or to run 
their are at the Boston Marathon uh-and even if they do 
those things they're usually fleeting and ultimately 
what-people really want to be training for is to be the 
most Kick-Ass versions of-themselves in the last decade of 
their life and you know again if that means-your 80 to 90 
years are functioning like you're a really good 70y old 
that's a-totally different experience from what most people 
go through and so let's say-someone is training for the 
centinary and cathlon so they kind of agree and-they say 
you know I want to put all my focus into this which is how 
do I become-like an athlete focused on life um and we don't 
have to get into these in-detail because in the show notes 
we link to the multiple multiple places we've-talked about 
them but what are the four components that you think are 
important-for someone who is interested in training for the 
centinary cathlon you-starts on the foundation right you 
have to have stability you have to have the-chassis um and 
that you know basically I'd say the chassis and the tires 
right-so you have to you have to have every aspect of the 
motor control coordination-ability to dissipate force uh 
ability to receive Force um ability to balance-motor you 
know there's so much that goes into stability I think got a 
a full half-chapter in the book um and it's far and away 
the most complicated to explain but-it's really obvious to 
see it when it's not there so you know this is every one-of 
us is lacking inst stability and it was the biggest 
re-education for me as I-pivoted to this way of training um 
so it's it's everything from learning how-to appropriately 
pressurize your inter abdominal space to how to um unlock 
your-rib maintain an appropriate center of gravity how to 
be able to isometrically-contract muscles as necessary how 
to be able to do it under control how to have-good foot 
mechanics right I mean all of these things we've done 
dedicated-podcasts on because each component of this 
stability game is is quite nuanced-um and the good news is 
While most of us show up to the middle part of our 
life-with enormous deficits here they're all retrain we're 
we're actually still quite-plastic in our old age second 
component is strength um and I-would say a subcomponent of 
strength is power so even though we lose power very-quickly 
as we age the more we can maintain it the better and you 
can't-have power without strength and stability um the 
third component uh and-this is really more of a Continuum 
the third and fourth are part of a Continuum-of 
cardiorespiratory Fitness but we think of this you know I 
talk about this-as being a triangle so the base of the 
triangle is the aerobic efficiency so-this is the you know 
maximum fat oxidation ability this is your all day-Pace we 
want that to be as high as possible and then the peak of 
the-triangle is the V2 Max that's you know most adequately 
thought of as the engine-size so that's the peak aerobic 
output so those are those are the four-components and one 
of the exercises we do with both our patients and and 
and-the obviously the client's intent square is once you 
have a person's centenarian-de cathlon goals you break them 
down into what is-required so if you if you give me your 
list and you you know we can take that-list and we can say 
oh this requires a V2 Max of 31 milliliters per 
kilogram-per minute this requires uh an ability to sit this 
you know this way or this-requires this much strength in 
this domain this requires this type of hip-loading etc etc 
and then we can evaluate where a person is today and then 
say oh-okay well obviously today you can do all of those 
things but here's the predicted-trajectory of decline on 
each of those things and will you be above your-benchmarks 
in 40 years or will you be below them and for most of us 
myself-included uh at least on some of those Dimensions 
you're actually considerably-below them at your Target and 
therefore you have to raise the performance-currently to 
make sure you hit the targets in the future and like 
we-mentioned for anyone who is interested in further on 
anything exercise in the-show notes will link to the 
multiple podcasts articles Etc so people can dive-in but 
moving from exercise to your second favorite nutrition um I 
think-it'd be helpful to start kind of what's your 
framework for how you think about-nutrition because you 
don't necessarily think about nutrition as some people-talk 
about it which is this diet's best or this diet's best you 
kind of look at-it a little bit of a different way and so 
do you want to walk people through-your framework and how 
you assess nutrition and where someone is at in-their 
nutritional State yeah I mean I would say that nutrition is 
is a very-complicated thing to study I would say it's the 
messiest of all the pillars to-study probably even messier 
than emotional health although maybe that's-debatable but 
um you know the reasons for it are obvious and not 
worth-restating but it's for that reason that there were 
very few things that can be-stated in this field with a 
high high degree of certainty so unfortunately 
the-challenge in nutrition is you have a lot of people that 
speak with such insane-conviction and they talk about 
something as though it is absolutely correct even-though if 
you were putting an error bar on their statement it would 
dwarf-anything they're saying and truthfully I have been 
guilty of this right I think-12 years ago I was talking 
about nutrition with a level of certainty that-I don't 
think was warranted and so As the adage goes the further 
you get from-the shore the deeper the water and I think in 
my older age I'm actually quite-far out from the shore and 
I realize the water is awfully deep out here and 
there-aren't a lot of things that can be stated at a high 
enough degree of-certainty that you should act on them with 
you know almost Blind Faith so here-are the two that I can 
tell you with a very very high degree of-certainty the 
first is that the single most important input from 
nutrition to a-person's overall health is energy balance 
stated another way the energy-input of food is the first 
order determinant of-Health maybe stated another way the 
total calories you-consume would be the most important 
thing not the only thing I do not want-to suggest that a 
th000 calories of tic tacs is the same as 1,000 calories 
of-broccoli it is not but I'm also talking about this 
through the lens of Common-Sense and the truth of it is if 
if you subside on a diet of tic tacs you're-going to eat a 
lot more than a th000 calories of them because they're 
not-satiating and they're junk and they're Hollow so I want 
to be very clear that-the primary input is total energy but 
it is also impacted by many other things-including diet 
quality processing and macronutrient-distribution the 
second thing that is abundantly clear-is that protein is 
the macronutrient we should be least flexible on state 
it-another way we can be quite flexible on how much 
carbohydrate and fat we consume-to fill our energy needs 
but because protein is not consumed for the purpose-of ATP 
generation which is the principal reason we consume 
carbohydrates and fats-although fats are also essential for 
some structural-purposes we cannot be too flexible or 
compromising in our protein requirements-in other words if 
you really wanted to just come up with a single number 
to-give people I would say on average about 1.6 grams of 
protein per kilogram of-body weight should be consumed by 
everybody now again I hate saying that-because there's 
truly nothing that you can say across the board there 
are-clearly people who based on what they're eating 
will-need more protein and there are probably people who 
can get away with a little-bit less you know uh if you took 
a perfectly high quality PDC 1.0 protein-in a person who's 
not over the moon active they could probably get away 
with-1.2 grams or even one gram but boy anything below that 
and you're starting-to really miss out and by the way as 
you age that those requirements go up due to-anabolic 
resistance so again we can talk all day about every diet 
under the sun-and every religion and every faction of every 
religion around every dietary-tribe but the truth of it is 
it's really hard to find a scientist an actual-nutrition 
scientist I'm not talking about an influencer I'm not 
talking-about a health block I'm talking about actual 
people who work in Labs doing-nutrition who will who will 
kind of disagree with that statement there are-some but 
they are in the huge minority and interestingly they tend 
to avoid-using human data uh when they talk about those 
things but um when you when you-limit yourself to the 
species of Interest which is humans not rodents and-you 
talk about experimental data uh coupled with you know other 
insights um-those two things seem to matter the most how 
many calories are you getting not-too much not too little 
are you getting enough protein um obviously there are-other 
terms we certainly want to make sure you're getting 
enough-micronutrients as well and that you're avoiding 
toxins that tends to be less of-an issue today than it was 
a hundred years ago um but of course that's also-really 
interesting um but a lot of the other stuff Nick is details 
right so uh-when I'm looking at a patient given how 
important those things-are to me it makes sense to be 
evaluating those things at the outset so-when we do a dexa 
scan on somebody on day one and we can see how 
much-subcutaneous fat they have how much visceral fat they 
have how much muscle-mass they have and we can do a lot of 
advanced blood work and see how-metabolically healthy they 
are how well they dispose of glucose all these other-things 
I can very quickly answer three questions literally on 
First Contact-are you overnourished or undernourished and 
that really comes-down to energy balance how much fat do 
you have on your body and how well is it-distributed 
throughout your body where is it distributed second 
question are-you adequately muscled or are you underused 
third question are you-metabolically healthy or not and 
when you can answer those three questions-which you can in 
a very short perod of time with a relatively small amount 
of-data that tells you does this person need to eat more 
less or the same total-energy the same amount of protein or 
less and how important and what type of-exercise should 
they be doing to augment our-findings now because we're 
talking about nutrition I'll close this out by saying-most 
people when they do this come out slightly in the 
overnourished category-that's just another way of saying 
most people are overweight or obese right I-think the 
numbers are probably 70% of the population are 
overnourished or-significantly overnourished therefore most 
people when-you go through that whole treatment algorithm 
are going to be in the I need-to eat less Camp if you are 
in the I need to eat less Camp you now have three-ways to 
do that three strategies if you will the first is directly 
reducing-caloric intake so that says agnostic to what or 
when I eat I will simply eat-less this is the most direct 
way to do it um it has lots of pluses in minuses-which I've 
discussed in so much detail in other podcasts that we'll 
link to the-second method is I will identify something or 
some set of things in the-diet that I will remove from the 
diet I will restrict them this is called-dietary 
restriction and the more restrictive the elements of your 
diet-the more effective this technique is so if you only 
choose to restrict lettuce-this will have no effect if you 
restrict everything but potatoes meaning if the-only thing 
you allow yourself to eat is potatoes this will have an 
enormous-effect so again the more you restrict the better 
that works and then the third-strategy is time restriction 
where you limit the window in which you eat and-the 
narrower and narrower that window the greater the 
likelihood that you will-overall induce a caloric deficit 
so you know there's a lot more I can say about-nutrition we 
could get into the nuances of which type of fats are 
better-saturated fats monounsaturated polyunsaturated fats 
is a Mediterranean-diet more efficacious than a low carb 
diet or um uh a lowfat diet and again-all of those things 
uh again I've written about I've spoken about but but-I 
think from from the standpoint of like what are the most 
important things I-think that I think you've got it have 
you remembered what you ate for lunch-yet that's I think 
the only thing from the nutrition conversation 
that's-missing I scarfed down some leftover spaghetti 
squash that we made yesterday-and what else did I have oh I 
had I had a uh a a like a container of uh uh-blackberries 
and I had some venison there you go great um moving on-to 
sleep so sleep is something you've written about where you 
take it much-more seriously now than maybe you used to in 
the past so do you want to talk-about why you think sleep 
is such an important component of not only lifespan-but 
also Health span you know I think the data really make the 
case more-compellingly than than I need to um there's just 
you know again fortunately-short-term sleep deprivation is 
easy to study um and it unequivocally-demonstrates uh a 
remarkable uh negative impact on-cognition on physical 
performance on physical markers of Health such as-insulin 
resistance on appetite everything that can go wrong in 
the-human body goes wrong when you are sleep deprived-um 
and again what's nice about this is you don't need-to do 
fiveyear studies to figure this out right you can do two 
week three week-studies where you take people down to four 
hours a night of sleep and you can-absolutely destroy them 
in every physiologic measure During the wakeful-period of 
their lives so we can then extrapolate from-there that okay 
well if you're only sleeping 5 and a half or 6 hours a 
night-you're probably not getting as much of the negative 
effects but when we see and-measure other effects that are 
negative to a lesser extent it seems pretty easy-to 
attribute them to the reduction of sleep so in other words 
um when you look-at a person who's you know not sleeping as 
inadequately as PE people are-typically studied in uh 
short-term studies geared towards identifying the-risks um 
they get many of the same problems but just not as extreme 
um-suggesting there's a dose effect to sleep-reduction um 
and you know truthfully I think that-um this is something 
that I think Society is far more willing to entertain-today 
than 10 years ago um I think you know Matt walker uh who's 
who's also a-very close personal friend has had a lot to do 
with this uh Ariana Huffington has-brought a lot of 
attention to this um so I think there are many people out 
there-that are saying hey this whole idea of I'll sleep 
when I'm dead which used to-be my Mantra uh is like yeah 
you're going to be dead quicker if you adopt-that Mantra so 
you will indeed sleep when you're dead and you'll be 
dead-sooner than you want to be so um again I I I think 
that you know this-this one doesn't require a lot of 
convincing um the how to do it of course-is a little more 
complicated um the good news is there's really a lot 
of-wonderful behavioral tools um and ultimately for some 
people you know-pharmacology or mechanical assistant such 
as CPAP you know if a person has-apnea there there are 
Technologies both pharmacologic and otherwise that 
can-really help here but for most people uh the behavioral 
tools do the work um this-is really one of those things 
where very few people need to see a physician to-help them 
sleep or to troubleshoot a sleep problem and when you 
do-fortunately there's an entire branch of medicine 
dedicated to sleep physiology-there are actual Physicians 
who specialize in this and um we're-certainly not afraid to 
use them when it's necessary there's also a field 
of-behavioral therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia that is-an entire discipline that is dedicated 
towards the cognitive tools that you can-use during Peri 
periods of insomnia so um you know we always get patients 
in-our practice um who just have what can only be described 
as the most abjectly-horrible sleep and I I I I just of all 
the problems we face this is the one-that I tend to be most 
optimistic about our ability to help in a relatively-short 
period of time and we have a whole AMA dedicated to sleep 
along with-multiple Matt Walker episodes so I don't think 
we need to get into insane detail-because we will link it 
in the show notes but you mentioned a few of the-behavioral 
tools and so if someone says okay I need to take more 
awareness of my-sleep I need to do more to get better sleep 
what are some of the things that-they can look at and 
evaluate I would say if you were you know if we were in-an 
elevator and we had only between the first floor and the 
15th floor for me to-tell you everything that mattered I 
would say uh try to go to bed at the-same time and wake up 
at the same time every day give yourself about 8 hours 
to-be in bed make the room as dark as possible as cold as 
possible and detach-yourself from anything stimulating 
especially kind of upsetting-which is you know work social 
media that kind of stuff for two hours before bed-and if we 
haven't hit the 15th floor yet I would say try to not eat 
or drink any-alcohol for 3 hours before bed those would be 
like the no risk no regret-moves to try to fix your sleep 
and that's a lot by the way like I I'm not-suggesting that 
would be easy to do for someone who's doing none of them um 
but-if a person if you gave me a hundred people who were 
complaining of poor-sleep and or objectively had 
measurements of poor sleep and all 80 of-them did that 
pardon me all a hundred of them did that I think 80 of them 
would-get better moving to drugs and supplements this is 
something that you-know if you look at all the different 
drugs phalic if you look at all the-supplements we have an 
insane amount of content on um impossible to answer all-the 
questions here that come in but I think helping people 
understand just-what their relationship with drugs and 
supplements should be how they should-think about it how 
they should not think about it you know how do you talk 
to-patients about that who come in to the practice and 
maybe have a list of 20-supplements that they show up with 
well I mean yeah that's definitely one-phenotype but I I 
would say just to kind of address both extreme right you 
have-some people who think everything is solved by drugs 
and supplements um and-then you have people who think you 
should never take a drug or a supplement-um and so I just 
always kind of try to remind people like drugs and 
supplements-are just a tool it's it's like to say I never 
want to take a drug is kind of-like you know telling a 
contractor hey please do a good job building my house-but 
just never use the hammer um or never use the Philips 
screwdriver you-can use the Robertson but not the Phillips 
um you just want to have tools-we just want to have tools 
and the best contractor and Carpenter and Tradesman-is 
going to have the most tools and the most facility with 
knowing how and when-to use them so um that said we do kind 
of especially-on the supplement side have a framework 
because as you said there's a in an-infinite number of 
supplements there's a finite number of regulated drugs but 
a-nonfinite number of supplements so you have to have a 
framework for this thing-right and so the first question 
I'm always asking myself with any exogenous-molecule is is 
this a molecule that is being taken to lengthen lifespan 
or-improve health span you would be amazed at how 
many-times I ask somebody who's taking a supplement which 
of those two they're-taking it for usually you get a very 
Blank-Stare I'm taking because fill-in the blank influencer 
told me to take-it okay so let's say we can establish that 
you were taking this for one of-those reasons it's either 
going to make me live longer and or it's going to-improve 
my physical cognitive or emotional-health the next question 
I would say is okay if this is a lifespan enhancer if-this 
is going to make you live longer is it doing it by 
targeting a specific-disease or is it a broad 
geroprotective molecule similarly if you're telling me-this 
is a health span enhancer is it specifically enhancing 
cognitive health-physical performance emotional health okay 
uh or is it sort of acting through-some mechanism we don't 
understand I would ask if we have safety data on this-I 
would ask if we have efficacy data in humans and or in 
animals if not and if-in animals how how relatable is it if 
it's a supplement I would ask how can we-control for Purity 
right how do we know that what what the bottle says is in 
it-is actually what's in it and that nothing that's not 
supposed to be in it-isn't in it there are a few more 
questions but that's the long and short-of it and and so I 
I think um one needs to go through that type of exercise 
and-put that type of filter to everything and and then and 
only then I think-should we go down the path of okay you 
know what supplements do we want to use-you know where do 
we to turn to pharmacology hormones those things and-moving 
to the last kind of tactic and you talk a little bit about 
this cuz you-know emotional health fits in the health span 
bucket as well but you know when-people think about 
longevity emotional health is not something that 
usually-comes up a lot and so what would you say to someone 
who maybe is taking the steps-in their nutrition their 
exercise their sleep you know drugs and supplements but-not 
necessarily focusing on their emotional health what would 
your advice-to them be on how emotional health you don't 
necessarily correlate it all the-time with longevity but 
you find it to be an important aspect well I mean I-think 
there's two components I I I think there-is enough evidence 
um though you could never prove it that um that you know 
a-person who's um managing their stress better-who's 
happier and who has relationships probably also lives 
longer-um certainly the epidemiology suggests all of that 
that's that's that's not-unclear um but but I'm 
acknowledging that that would be very difficult 
to-demonstrate causality right there could be you know 
people could be happier and-have better relationships and 
all those things because their health is better so-it could 
be reverse causality there but but I think there's actually 
enough-evidence that that that that there's at least 
bidirectional uh causality there-but I think to to help 
somebody think about this I would say just forget 
that-let's pretend that being miserable lonely and angry 
helped you live longer-and that if you were happy and you 
had great relationships and you were in-harmony you would 
live shorter who would choose the former when-you frame it 
that way right outside of extremes like okay happy people 
can't-live past 30 miserable people can live to 100 I'm 
sure a lot of people would-say well I'd rather be miserable 
at 100 but the the truth of it is like even-framed that way 
it seems ridiculous right so all of that is to say as 
a-thought experiment just forget the lifespan piece of this 
just think of it-through the lens of common sense why would 
you ever choose to be-unhappy it doesn't make sense and I 
think what maybe for me was a big-insight late in life was 
you can do something about this you you it's not-you know 
um everybody's got a story everybody's got a history 
everybody's-got a background that brings them to the to the 
table um but it's all modifiable-right so the software can 
be modified is the point and um you know again we've-got so 
much content on this that I I obviously couldn't go into it 
in any-detail here but um you know I think the most 
important thing for the purpose of-this discussion is that 
this entire area is as important potentially more-important 
than all of the others because without this one in check 
the other ones-don't matter and Peter I think that kind of 
wraps what we were hoping to cover-and again as we kind of 
mentioned on the outset the idea is not to get into 
the-Super intense details on everything we'll link to that 
but more so cover-high level kind of longevity 101 how you 
think think about some core aspects for-people who are 
newer people who need a refresher I think the last thing 
that I-we should end with is just if someone is new and 
they're listening to this and-they maybe feel a little bit 
overwhelmed on where they should start right a lot-of 
information came out on the lifespan Health span different 
diseases different-tactics you know what advice would you 
give someone who is listening and they-would say you know 
what I I want to take this more seriously but I'm a 
little-overwhelmed on where to start I would say just pick 
one yeah I think it's um-it's not a race and um I think 
finding something that you think you're going to-be 
successful in would be the best first place to start so if 
after listening to-everything we just talked about you're 
kind of like you know what really-resonates with me my 
sleep probably sucks then I would say how about you-change 
nothing in your nutrition nothing in your exercise don't do 
anything else-don't buy a supplement just work on 
implementing the stuff we-talked about on sleep because if 
you get that better it's going to do two things-it's going 
to make it easier for you to address the other things and 
it's going-to give you the confidence and agency that says 
hey I actually have control-over this thing it's not out of 
my hands awesome well Peter hopefully people-enjoyed this 
special episode but thank you for your time and we'll see 
you on-the next one sounds great [Music]-no
