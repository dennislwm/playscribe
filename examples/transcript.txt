hello everyone my name is April and I'll be your for 
tonight let's have some fun-[Applause] [Music]-together hi 
I'm April Kim I'm the Korean to English interpreter and MC 
for the-K-pop SL K artist in [Music]-Singapore so I 
initially started as a marketer there was opportunity to 
like-interpret for an event organized by the Korean 
Association and then after that I-got WhatsApp contact 
saying like hey actually we need someone to interpret-for 
our show I was like sure why not cuz I'm already 
comfortable talking in front-of people and then like I 
realized that talking for people would be so much fun-and 
then now I'm an interpreter fulltime I'll say there were 
three viral-moments a first viral moment was the t concert 
last year I love T so much oh my-God okay [Music]-oh what 
happened was it was her last stop in her Asian tour so you 
can-imagine how happy at the and at the same time sad so 
she was trying to imply it-by using some like edium like a 
Korean term she wants HPS of pale which is like-can she 
interpret it and I'm like sure why not and she caught that 
and she was-like oh thank you interpreter for like implying 
my emotions so well so I-interpreted her compliment and 
once that was over crying-cuz tan usually don't compliment 
The Interpreter in the-show hello April hello hello she's 
my interpreter can I continue to use this-word for IU she 
like purposely asked my name as part of the show to 
introduce me-as her interpreter to her audience that was 
the first official introduction as a-person I was pulled 
out from the Shadow and be introduced as a person for 
the-first time so I think that's when also other people 
start to recognize me as a-person not just an interpreter 
which felt so-different it is so good oh thank-you no it's 
so-good from my perspective on the monitor it looked really 
beautiful how fans are-making way for yonga and then when 
he asked for second time the fans did it-again I was like 
that's so cool that's so beautiful so when y said like no 
so-good I was like yeah I should definitely tell the 
audience how happy he is by-imitating it and he laughed 
laughed laughed and the S went to PTO was like-go go go 
continue this is perfect until the moment that he started 
rapping I was-like okay you want the rap I'll do the rap 
and I just wrapped-these days you have so many meeting with 
other people these-days because interpretation is basically 
being a spokesperson for either a-businessman or an artist 
it's not just interpreting and translating it's like-also 
understanding what's the intention of this person what is 
the question that-they want to ask and what is the answer 
they want to hear and what would be the-next follow-up 
questions they want to know so is it's more about 
predicting-what do they want to get out of this 
conversation or meeting it's a unique-job I love it it's so 
much [Music]-fun ooh the misconception is that I take photo 
with the artist and I'm their best-friend that is a 
misconception guys as an enterpr and also as an MC we-are 
supposed to be professional so the most difficult part of 
doing this job is-to not be a fan girl which I am so we're 
not supposed to talk to them unless the-artist request it's 
rare but sometimes like-artist request to take a photo or 
like talk to me after the show because they-want to show 
the appreciation so there are moments like that latest one 
Wasa-from Mama Mo she was really-[Music] kind for the 
interpretation I am usually-placed at the backstage with 
the one monitor to see the artist's face cuz-when they're 
talking sometimes they can be sarcastic right and I cannot 
tell by-just ear so I have a monitor to check the artist 
expression and it's called-feedback Monitor and usually I 
have one mic for a concert and two mics for the-fan meeting 
so I'm interpreting from English to Korean for the artist 
in One-mic which the audience cannot listen to and then 
whenever the artist speak-Korean I interpret that to 
English which is broadcasted to the public that is 
on-another mic and I have my own earphone to listen to just 
the artist cuz usually-the fans get really loud with 
excitement and shears so I cannot hear anything-without the 
[Music]-earphone definitely the fendom culture is one thing 
that I always look out for-like how does the artist call 
their fans cuz there's a formal way of calling but-also 
they have their own nicknames for the fans and what are the 
latest topic-that they talked about internally or also like 
in the interview like what are-the things that artists like 
at the moment because fans want to know what-artists like 
not the setup questions right I want to make sure 
that-everything is natural when I interpret it like as if I 
am the fan or as if I'm-in the brain of the artist to 
understand this chemistry it takes me usually like-3 days 
at least like 3 to 6 hours of research every day because 
like it's not-just about reading but also watching all the 
YouTube clips that not only the-agency created or the 
artist himself herself created but also the fanmade-videos 
really important those are the points that the fans-[Music] 
love before the show definitely like for-example like first 
gen second gen artists they have so many data it-doesn't 
end one thing really interesting is that they're human 
being and we just-forget about it but when you did the 
research you realized that they also-change they have their 
own Journey they had their own ups and downs so you-realize 
that this information that I searched about him in like 
about his-early 20 doesn't apply to him anymore in late 30 
during the events definitely-stamina is one thing cuz 
you're paying extra attention on every single 
sound-especially the artist is fluent in English they will 
switch it back and-forth and you need to decide on that 
instant second if you're going to-interpret it or not so 
paying attention to even the like breathing of the 
artist-to see if he's going to speak or if he's not going 
to speak-[Music] scary honestly I'm like I'm 
really-grateful don't take me wrongly I'm like really 
grateful that people recognize me-and especially the artist 
show appreciation to me and then like calling-my name 
everything it really feels like a-dream I feel 
responsibility towards this recognition Force this like 
affection-and love that people are showing that means they 
trust me they trust me that-when I'm doing an 
interpretation or when I'm doing mcing it's got to be fun 
and-I'm like I don't want to disappoint you so basically 
like I'm grateful at the-same time I'm like ooh I need to 
do better I need to do better there's a lot-of pressure on 
[Music]-me my goal is to actually speak Chinese fluent 
enough so I can do interpretation-in Chinese as well so 
that's next thing coming up the first thing I wake up I 
do-do a lingo to learn Chinese then eat breakfast while 
watching Chinese Dr-drama or movie so I can like open my 
ears and open my mouth-[Music]
