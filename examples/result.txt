# SUMMARY
The discussion explores the evolution of medicine from 1.0 to 3.0, highlighting the transition from ineffective practices to a focus on prevention and health span.

# IDEAS:
- Medicine 1.0 dominated human existence until the late 19th century.
- Early medicine relied on beliefs in gods, spirits, and humors.
- Life expectancy during Medicine 1.0 was around 30-40 years.
- Major causes of death included communicable diseases and maternal mortality.
- The scientific method, codified by Francis Bacon, revolutionized medicine.
- The introduction of the light microscope and germ theory advanced medical understanding.
- Medicine 2.0 emerged with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enhancing treatment efficacy.
- Lifespan doubled from the late 1800s to the early 2000s due to medical advancements.
- Medicine 2.0 effectively manages many acute conditions today.
- Chronic diseases have become the leading causes of death in modern times.
- Medicine 3.0 aims to address the shortcomings of Medicine 2.0.
- A shift in resource allocation is needed towards preventive care in Medicine 3.0.
- Health span should be prioritized alongside lifespan in medical practice.
- Medicine 3.0 focuses on early intervention and personalized treatment.
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is largely preventable through lifestyle changes.
- The Four Horsemen of death include atherosclerosis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic diseases.
- Public health initiatives are crucial for preventing diseases like COPD.
- The healthcare economy needs a balanced investment between treatment and prevention.
- Medicine 3.0 emphasizes tailored therapies based on individual evidence.
- Health span is often neglected in current medical practices.

# QUOTES:
- "Medicine 1.0...was largely ineffective."
- "The median life expectancy would have been into the late 30s or early 40s."
- "Francis Bacon codifying the scientific method...is something we take for granted today."
- "Human lifespan approximately doubled."
- "Medicine 2.0 was and remains an enormous success."
- "Lifespan has largely faltered."
- "The leading causes of death today are very different types of diseases."
- "Medicine 3.0 is to try to address where medicine 2.0 has fallen short."
- "Health span is to be given at least as much effort and attention as lifespan."
- "Medicine 3.0 really has two main hallmarks."
- "We need to shift resources away from solely focusing on medicine 2.0."
- "When it hits the fan...you want medicine 2.0 there to backstop those things."
- "Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death in modern times."
- "The purpose of medicine 3.0 is to prevent rather than treat chronic disease."
- "Most healthcare dollars are spent on addressing lifespan."

# FACTS:
- Homo sapiens have existed for about 250,000 years.
- Life expectancy was significantly lower before the late 19th century.
- The introduction of sanitation practices contributed to increased lifespan.
- The scientific method was not utilized in early medical practices.
- Randomized controlled trials became a cornerstone of modern medicine.
- Major advancements in medicine occurred between the Civil War and World War I.
- Chronic diseases now dominate causes of death compared to infectious diseases.
- COPD is primarily caused by cigarette smoking, a public health issue.
- The Four Horsemen of death include coronary artery disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic diseases.
- Lifespan improvements occurred over just a century, a small fraction of human history.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Shift healthcare resources towards preventive measures in Medicine 3.0.
- Focus on health span as much as lifespan in medical practices.
- Tailor therapies based on individual patient needs and evidence.
- Invest in public health initiatives to reduce preventable diseases like COPD.
- Encourage early intervention strategies for chronic disease management.
- Educate healthcare providers on the importance of health span.
- Allocate healthcare funding more evenly between treatment and prevention efforts.
- Promote lifestyle changes to mitigate chronic disease risks.
- Foster research into personalized medicine approaches for chronic conditions.
