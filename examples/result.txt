## SUMMARY
Patrick from STH shares a quick tip on downloading ISOs directly to a Proxmox VE host for creating KVM virtual machines.

## IDEAS:
- Downloading ISOs directly to the Proxmox VE host simplifies the VM creation process.
- Changing the directory to `/var/lib/vz/template/iso` is essential for local ISO images.
- Using `wget` allows for easy downloading of ISO files from URLs.
- Creating a VM template can save time by avoiding repeated installations from ISOs.
- Having multiple OS ISOs available is beneficial for flexibility in VM creation.
- Scripting the download of multiple ISOs can streamline the process further.
- Local ISOs are useful for quick installations when time is critical.
- Utilizing network data stores can help save on storage costs as you scale.
- The process of downloading ISOs can be completed in just a few steps.
- A shout-out to QuadraNet for hosting the LAX mirror for ISO downloads.

## QUOTES:
- "We wanted to share an easy way to load ISOs and this is one that we've used for years."
- "This task essentially has three easy steps."
- "You need to change the directory."
- "We can simply use URL of a silly one and wget and we can wait a few seconds."
- "We strongly suggest making your first VM a template."
- "You probably will want to have at least some OS as well."
- "You can repeat this process as needed."
- "It is handy to have ISOs locally when you get into a pinch."
- "As you get more advanced, you may also want to add ISOs on a network data store."
- "This is an easy way to clear the first hurdle for making VMs."

## FACTS:
- Proxmox VE is a platform for creating KVM virtual machines.
- The local path for ISO images in Proxmox VE is `/var/lib/vz/template/iso`.
- The `wget` command is commonly used for downloading files from the internet.
- Ubuntu is a popular choice for virtual machine installations.
- Having multiple templates can enhance efficiency in VM management.
- Network data stores can reduce local storage requirements.
- The process of downloading ISOs can be automated with scripts.
- Quick access to ISOs can be crucial during urgent setups.
- The STH main site offers additional resources and videos on Proxmox VE.
- Subscribing to their YouTube channel provides ongoing tips and updates.
