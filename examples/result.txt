# SUMMARY
Kei from Investment Modes discusses the Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) framework for income planning, particularly for Singaporeans, and its adaptability for different financial needs.

# IDEAS:
- The Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) is a framework for income planning.
- It helps determine how much one can spend from their portfolio.
- The 4% rule is a commonly cited SWR guideline.
- Different asset allocations can affect the SWR's effectiveness.
- Financial independence may require longer income needs.
- The SWR framework is adaptable to various financial situations.
- Historical data can inform safe withdrawal strategies.
- A 50% equity and 50% fixed-income allocation is often recommended.
- The success rate of a withdrawal strategy can vary based on market conditions.
- Inflation-adjusted income is crucial for long-term planning.
- A lower withdrawal rate increases the likelihood of portfolio longevity.
- Generational wealth planning requires careful consideration of withdrawal rates.
- The framework can accommodate different time horizons for income needs.
- A 3% to 3.5% withdrawal rate is considered safer for long-term planning.
- Portfolio costs should be factored into withdrawal calculations.

# QUOTES:
- "The short answer is yes it can be adaptable."
- "This is a good model how it looks like visually."
- "This income will last for about 25 years."
- "If you require the income to last long, then the safe withdrawal rate is lower."
- "You can work backwards to determine how much capital you should have."
- "If your allocation is 100% stocks, there are a lot of unique 30-year periods."
- "If you're unlucky, there are certain scenarios where it won't work."
- "If you want a plan that leans more towards a robust one, you're probably looking at somewhere close to 3%."
- "You should go lower from 3% minus your portfolio cost."
- "It's not like a strategy that sells units; it preserves capital value."
