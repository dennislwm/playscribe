## SUMMARY
A discussion about the weather, personal experiences with heat, and an introduction to Fast Stats, a GitLab tool for log parsing.

## IDEAS:
- The current weather is unusually hot and humid, reaching close to 90°F.
- Personal anecdotes about family members in Amsterdam and Madrid experiencing heat.
- Fast Stats is a GitLab tool built in Rust for parsing log files.
- It aggregates log data to provide insights like request counts and error rates.
- Fast Stats is not a substitute for tools like Splunk or Grafana but offers quick log analysis.
- The tool can visualize data by generating PNG files from logs.
- Users can compare performance metrics against benchmark systems.
- Fast Stats can handle various log types, including production and API logs.
- The tool saves significant time compared to manual log parsing methods.
- It allows users to filter and sort log data efficiently.
- Fast Stats can be run locally on a Mac or compiled on Linux.
- The tool supports output in multiple formats, including JSON and CSV.
- It can help identify performance issues quickly by analyzing historical log data.
- Fast Stats can be integrated into existing workflows for easier log management.
- The tool is useful for troubleshooting customer issues by providing quick insights.
- It can be used in cloud-native environments by scraping logs from pods.

## QUOTES:
- "This week is kind of an exception so every day is around 90ish degrees."
- "I had no clue even existed until just recently."
- "What it does is it will go through all your different log files."
- "This is a lot faster than parsing through JSON in Vim or something like that."
- "This price saved me three days what I just did right here."
- "You can actually cap through unzip all the archived log files."
- "You can do benches against those versions."
- "This is pushing to the logs exactly what you see."
- "This could be very useful in running this against different log files."
- "The documentation is good for telling you what the options are."
- "I think this presentation is really useful."
- "I believe if I can just put it to the file then I can work with the Fast Stats."
- "This is definitely a nicer thing to visualize."
- "The amount of time to parse through JSON by hand is crazy."
- "It's written in Rust, pretty impressive."
- "I think it gives you slightly different output."

## FACTS:
- The temperature reached close to 90°F in the discussed region.
- Fast Stats is built in Rust and designed for log parsing.
- The tool provides performance metrics like request counts and error rates.
- Fast Stats can generate visual representations of log data as PNG files.
- It allows users to analyze logs from various sources, including production and API logs.
- The tool can save users significant time compared to manual methods.
- Fast Stats supports multiple output formats, including JSON and CSV.
- It can be used in cloud-native environments by scraping logs from Kubernetes pods.
- The tool is part of GitLab's support team toolbox.
- Fast Stats has been around for at least two years.
