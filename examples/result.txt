# SUMMARY
A video discusses the controversial history and recommendations of vitamin D, highlighting its health benefits and questioning the established RDA figures.

# IDEAS:
- The RDA for vitamin D is set at 600 IUs, an arbitrary number decided by a committee.
- Vitamin D has been controversial for over a century due to its health benefits.
- Historically, heliotherapy was used to treat various ailments before modern medicine.
- The recommended 600 IUs is equivalent to just 1.8 minutes of summer sun exposure.
- A study found no toxicity in high doses of vitamin D (200,000 to 1 million IUs).
- Vitamin D3 acts as an immune-modulator, crucial for overall health.
- Reevaluations suggest the RDA should be closer to 8,895 IUs.
- Researchers faced backlash for presenting new data on vitamin D's benefits.
- Latitude correlates with disease risk; lower risks are found near the equator.
- Rickets was common in the early 1900s, leading to the discovery of vitamin D.
- The recommended intake of vitamin D has changed slowly over decades.
- Medications often prescribe high doses of vitamin D (50,000 IUs) while general recommendations remain low.
- A campaign in the 80s promoted sun avoidance, linking it to skin cancer fears.
- Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to melanoma development.
- Factors like skin color and age affect vitamin D absorption.
- Modern medicine may prefer low vitamin D doses to maintain control over health.

# QUOTES:
- "600 IUS is basically standing out in the sun in the summer 1.8 minutes."
- "The government wasted a whole lot of money here for you to conduct these worthless studies."
- "Vitamin D3 is very special in that it's an immune-modulator."
- "The darker the skin, the less absorption of vitamin D you get."
- "You can take it if it's prescribed through medication but everyone else... take 400."
- "Melanoma develops in areas where you're not exposed to Sun."
- "Vitamin D is needed in 2700 different genes."
- "There are so many barriers for absorbing vitamin D3."
- "The more you weigh, the less vitamin D you're going to absorb."
- "This is just scratching the surface if you want the complete data on this history."

# FACTS:
- Heliotherapy was used to treat tuberculosis and asthma before antibiotics.
- The initial recommendation for vitamin D was 400 IUs in 1946.
- In 2010, the recommendation increased to 600 IUs for adults under 70.
- Vitamin D deficiency was linked to rickets in the early 1900s.
- The Institute of Medicine updated RDAs multiple times over decades.
- Vitamin D resistance can occur genetically, affecting absorption rates.
- Skin cancer rates are higher in areas with less sun exposure.
- Vitamin D is involved in numerous genetic functions within the body.
- The recommended intake for older adults is higher than for younger adults.
- Studies have shown that high doses of vitamin D do not lead to toxicity.
