# SUMMARY
A video tutorial on building multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, focusing on integrating text and images using various approaches.

# IDEAS:
- Most existing rack systems focus solely on text.
- Multimodal systems can enhance information retrieval by including images and tables.
- The first approach involves embedding different modalities into a unified vector space.
- Using models like CLIP can help create embeddings for both text and images.
- The second approach grounds all modalities into a primary text modality.
- Converting images to text descriptions can unify the data for retrieval.
- Separate vector stores for different modalities can improve retrieval accuracy.
- A multimodal ranker is necessary to determine the relevance of retrieved chunks.
- CLIP stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, released by OpenAI in 2021.
- OpenCLIP is an open-source implementation of the original CLIP model.
- The tutorial will use Wikipedia articles as a data source for extraction.
- The process can also be applied to PDFs and Word documents.
- The video will demonstrate code implementation using Lama Index and Quadrant Vector Store.
- Quantized embeddings can optimize vector store size and performance.
- The tutorial will cover how to set up API keys for OpenAI models.
- Users can run queries on the multimodal vector store to retrieve relevant information.
- The results may vary based on the specificity of user queries.
- Future videos will explore more complex multimodal RAG solutions.

# QUOTES:
- "Having the ability to not only be able to ask questions related to the text... but also retrieve the corresponding multimedia documents is extremely helpful."
- "This is going to be the first iteration and later on we're going to build a very powerful system."
- "The first approach is to embed all different modalities into a single Vector space."
- "We will need to have this extra multimodal ranker that needs to be a capable model."
- "CLIP stands for contrastive language image pre-training."
- "OpenCLIP is an open-source implementation of the original CLIP model."
- "The process took a little bit of time and the resultant Vector store has a size of almost 300 MB."
- "You can do the same process with PDFs as well."
- "If you're looking for very specific information you could provide much more customized queries."
- "I hope you found this video useful."

# FACTS:
- Most rack systems are primarily focused on text only.
- CLIP was released by OpenAI in 2021.
- OpenCLIP is trained on more data than the original CLIP model.
- The tutorial uses Wikipedia articles for data extraction.
- The process can be applied to various document types, including PDFs and Word files.
- Quantized embeddings can balance performance and speed increase.
- The video discusses using Lama Index and Quadrant Vector Store for implementation.
- The resultant vector store from the tutorial is approximately 300 MB in size.
