- Exercise is the most impactful intervention for both lifespan and health span.
- The Centenarian Decathlon is a framework for training to maintain functionality in later life.
- Nutrition's primary determinant is energy balance, with protein being crucial for health.
- Sleep deprivation negatively impacts cognition and physical health.
- Emotional health is essential for overall well-being and longevity.
