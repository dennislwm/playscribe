# SUMMARY
Jim discusses deploying Kubernetes using Talos OS, a lightweight, purpose-built operating system designed for Kubernetes, highlighting its features and setup process.

# IDEAS:
- Talos OS is specifically designed to host Kubernetes.
- It is lightweight and has a simple setup process.
- The operating system features a unique user interface.
- Talos OS emphasizes security through immutability and minimalism.
- It eliminates configuration drift and unknown factors.
- Talos OS receives atomic updates for specific components.
- The OS is certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
- It operates without remote connections like SSH, reducing brute force risks.
- The setup process can be automated using Ansible scripts.
- Talos runs in live mode before installation, allowing for quick boot times.
- The configuration process involves generating and applying configuration files.
- Talos CTL is the command line tool used for managing Talos OS.
- The setup includes a triple control plane for high availability.
- Users can create VMs in Proxmox to run Talos OS.
- The installation process can be done via Docker for quick experimentation.
- The video provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a minimal HA cluster.
- Talos allows for easy addition of worker nodes to the cluster.
- The speaker plans to explore more advanced features in future videos.
- The simplicity of Talos OS makes it suitable for home lab setups.
- The speaker encourages community contributions to improve the Ansible script.

# QUOTES:
- "Talos OS is an operating system specifically designed to host Kubernetes."
- "It's super lightweight because it's purpose-built."
- "There's predictability in terms of it eliminates configuration drift and unknown factors."
- "You receive Atomic updates so specific components that are updated in isolation."
- "This will get you up and running with a minimal HA cluster."
- "The operating system is running in live mode."
- "This is just basically taking those instructions we've seen and running them through an Ansible playbook."
- "This is much shorter and simpler good job Talos."
- "You can obviously check out that quick start guide where you can actually get TS up and running within Docker really quickly."
- "This just behaves like Kubernetes; this isn't k3s, this is full fat Kubernetes."
- "I'm going to be doing more of that in future videos."
- "If you've liked this video let me know how you're going to use this."
- "I haven't actually tried that; I'm going to be doing more of that in future videos."
- "Super clean, minimal, ephemeral, secure ticks all the boxes in my mind."
- "You can see that I've got this tals folder and now within the tals folder we've got a cube configuration file."

# FACTS:
- Talos OS is certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
- It operates without SSH connections, enhancing security.
- Atomic updates allow for isolated component updates.
- The setup includes a triple control plane for high availability.
- Talos CTL is similar to Cube CTL for managing configurations.
- The installation process can be done via Docker or command line.
- Proxmox can be used to create VMs for running Talos OS.
- The speaker's setup includes three master nodes and two worker nodes.
- Talos OS supports ephemeral and immutable configurations.
- The speaker mentions using Ansible for automation in deployment.
