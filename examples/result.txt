# SUMMARY
Dr. Michael Silber and Dr. MRI Juna discuss the evolution and current practices surrounding the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in diagnosing sleep disorders.

# IDEAS:
- The MSLT was developed by Mary Carscadden in 1978 for diagnosing narcolepsy.
- Sleep deprivation significantly affects MSLT results, with studies showing increased sleep latency after adequate sleep.
- The revised 2021 parameters emphasize the need for at least 7 hours of sleep before the MSLT.
- Actigraphy is recommended for monitoring sleep patterns leading up to the MSLT.
- Discontinuing psychotropic medications before the MSLT is crucial for accurate diagnosis.
- The 8-minute cut-off for narcolepsy diagnosis is not scientifically absolute and should be interpreted flexibly.
- The specificity of REM latency on polysomnography is very high for diagnosing narcolepsy type 1.
- Clinical suspicion should guide the interpretation of MSLT results, not just numerical cut-offs.
- The importance of patient education regarding sleep hygiene before testing is emphasized.
- The podcast highlights the need for controlled conditions during the MSLT to ensure valid results.
- There are exceptions for holding certain medications longer than two weeks before the MSLT.
- The integration of clinical acumen with MSLT results is essential for accurate diagnosis.
- The podcast aims to clarify common misconceptions about sleep testing protocols.
- The role of actigraphy in assessing sleep quality prior to the MSLT is discussed.
- The impact of shift work on sleep patterns and MSLT outcomes is noted.
- The necessity of a separate protocol for pre-MSLT polysomnography is highlighted.
- The podcast addresses the challenges faced by patients in achieving adequate sleep before testing.

# QUOTES:
- "The technique has been used in the diagnosis of narcolepsy for nearly 45 years."
- "It is absolutely vital for an accurate interpretation of the MSLT."
- "We suspect that even though they said they all slept adequately before, they were probably sleep deprived."
- "I want you to try achieve eight hours in bed every night."
- "If you don't take them off the anti-depressants, it's extremely hard to diagnose narcolepsy."
- "The specificity for that less than 15 minutes REM latency on the preceding polysomnogram was 98%."
- "The vast majority of narcoleptic patients will have latencies mean latencies of 8 minutes or less."
- "This is not like an isolated test; it's got to be integrated with the clinician's pre-test probabilities."
- "We try to get them off cannabis for a longer period than two weeks if we can."
- "The new criteria state that on the MSLT report, the physician has to put what drugs they were on at the time of the study."
- "It's important for everybody's sleep lab to have a separate protocol for pre-MSLT polysomnography."
- "I think we've got to use the MSLT as an extension of clinical method."
- "There are other ways of looking at narcolepsy, but we don't have a lot of other biomarkers."
- "After 45 years, the MSLT is still a very helpful and valid tool for the diagnosis of disorders of hypersomnolence."
- "You have to interpret it in that way."

# FACTS:
- The MSLT was first developed in 1978.
- A study showed that increasing sleep from 7 to 10 hours raised mean sleep latency from 6 to 11 minutes.
- The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort found increased odds of developing sleep onset REM periods among shift workers.
- The revised 2021 parameters clarified that at least 7 hours of sleep is necessary before an MSLT.
- Fluoxetine has a long half-life, necessitating a longer withdrawal period before testing.
- The specificity of REM latency in diagnosing narcolepsy type 1 is extremely high at 98%.
- The mean latency for proven narcolepsy patients was found to be 3.1 minutes in a significant study.
- The ICD3 TR introduced a new criterion stating that an MSLT may not be required if REM periods are present on polysomnography.
- Many patients may not remember what medications they were on prior to testing, complicating diagnoses.
- Shift work and insufficient sleep correlate with lower REM periods in community studies.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep nightly for two weeks before undergoing an MSLT.
- Use actigraphy to monitor sleep patterns leading up to the test whenever possible.
- Discontinue REM-suppressant medications at least two weeks prior to testing if feasible.
- Educate patients about the importance of sleep hygiene before their MSLT appointment.
- Consider individual patient circumstances when deciding on medication withdrawal timelines.
- Ensure that polysomnography is conducted under optimal conditions prior to an MSLT.
- Integrate clinical judgment with MSLT results for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
- Encourage patients to communicate any recent changes in their medication or health status before testing.
- Utilize separate protocols for pre-MSLT polysomnography to minimize disturbances during testing. 
- Be flexible with diagnostic criteria, understanding that individual patient presentations may vary.
